<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Crowning the Christ is an intensely practical
thing, whether taken in the <i>personal</i> sense or the
<i>world</i> sense. He has been crowned in the upper
world. With wondrous patience and graciousness
He pleads for the personal crowning in our
lives. Some day&mdash;no one knows just when&mdash;He
will begin to <i>act</i> as the crowned Christ <i>in all
the affairs of our earth</i>.</p>

<p>The initiative of all action to-day on the earth
is in man's hands. Some day the initiative of
<i>governing</i> action on the earth will be in the hands
of the crowned Christ, even while the personal
initiative of each man's life will still be in his own
hands.</p>

<p>God is intensely practical. Jesus was never
concerned about speculation nor mere discussion;
He was too intent on helping people. The Bible
is wholly a practical book. It is concerned only
with helping us. It does not tell us all the truth
there is; we shall be constantly learning more
in the future life. But it does tell us all we need
to know now. And its purpose in telling us what
it does is wholly practical,&mdash;to urge us to right
choice, and to lives that square with the choice.
This is the purpose that decided just what truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Page 6]</a></span>should be told in the Book.</p>

<p>There is one book of the sixty-six devoted
wholly to this subject of the crowned Christ,&mdash;&quot;The
Revelation of John.&quot; Every one of these
books touches Him at some angle, and finds its
deepest meaning in what He was to do and did
do, and yields up its secrets only under the touch
of His hand. But this book, the closing and climax
of all, the knot in the end of the inspired
thread, this deals wholly with the action of the
crowned Christ.</p>

<p>No book of the sixty-six has seemed so much
like a riddle and set so many a-guessing. And
without doubt much of its meaning will be clear
only as events work themselves out. Events will
prove the only expositor of much. But it is with
the deep conviction that this is wholly a <i>practical
book</i>, written wholly from a practical point of
view, and concerned wholly with our practical
daily lives, that I have ventured to take it up in
this series of simple, wholly practical, Quiet
Talks. And it is only this side of its teachings
that will be dealt with here. The Book is a street
leading into the true overcoming life the Master
would woo us to.</p>

<p>It is only after many years' study of this Book
of the Revelation, and a special study the past
three years and a little more, that I have ventured
to put these talks together. And now they are
sent out with the earnest humble prayer that
others may find some little practical help in
prayerfully reading, as I have found much in
prayerfully studying, under the Master's gracious
faithful touch.</p>

&quot;When God sought a King for His people of old,<br />
<span class="i1">He went to the fields to find him;</span><br />
A shepherd was he, with his crook and his lute<br />
<span class="i1">And a following flock behind him.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;O love of the sheep, O joy of the lute,<br />
<span class="i1">And the sling and the stone for battle;</span><br />
A shepherd was King, the giant was naught,<br />
<span class="i1">And the enemy driven like cattle.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;When God looked to tell of His good will to men,<br />
<span class="i1">And the Shepherd-King's son whom He gave them;</span><br />
To shepherds, made meek a-caring for sheep,<br />
<span class="i1">He told of a Christ sent to save them.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;O love of the sheep, O watch in the night,<br />
<span class="i1">And the glory, the message, the choir;</span><br />
'Twas shepherds who saw their King in the straw,<br />
<span class="i1">And returned with their hearts all on fire.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;When Christ thought to tell of His love to the world<br />
<span class="i1">He said to the throng before him,</span><br />
'The Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep&mdash;'<br />
<span class="i1">And away to the cross they bore Him.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;O love of the sheep, O blood sweat of prayer,<br />
<span class="i1">O man on the cross, God-forsaken;</span><br />
A shepherd has gone to defend all alone<br />
<span class="i1">The sheepfold by death overtaken.</span><br />
</p><p>
&quot;When God sought a King for His people, for aye,<br />
<span class="i1">He went to the grave to find him;</span><br />
And a shepherd came back, Death dead in His grasp,<br />
<span class="i1">And a following flock behind Him.</span><br />
</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>[1] Joseph Addison Richards.</p></div>
<p>&quot;O love of the sheep, O life from the dead,<br />
<span class="i1">O strength of the faint and the fearing;</span><br />

<h4>Coronation Gift.</h4>

<p>Christ is crowned. Not in any vague far-fetched
meaning, but in the plain common-sense
meaning of the word, He is <i>crowned</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[2] Mark xvi. 19.</p></div><p>For crowned means put in the place of highest
power, with full right to exercise that power at
will. And when the crucified Jesus went up that
Olivet day, before the astonished eyes of the disciples,
into the sightless blue, on the cloud, He
was received in the upper world by the Father.
And He was lifted up into the place of highest
honour and greatest power. He sat down at the
right hand of the Father.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><span class="snlabel">[2]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[3] Matthew xxvi. 64.</p></div><p>He had said it would be so. Breathing the air
thick with bitter hate on the night of His trial,
He had quietly said to the Jewish rulers that
even so it would be, bringing at once about His
person the bursting of the storm of hate.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><span class="snlabel">[3]</span> Now
His unfaltering trust in His Father has its sweet
reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[4] Acts ii. 33; iii. 13-16; v. 31-32; vii. 55, 56.</p></div><p>The Holy Spirit poured out on Pentecost, the
birthday of the Church, was the gift of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</a></span>
<i>crowned</i> Christ. The rushing sound as of a mighty
wind that filled all the house, the tongues of flame
plainly seen, the bold talking to the crowds of
foreign Jews of God's mighty power, the faithful
witnessing about the crucified Jesus in the
city that hounded Him to death, the convinced
crowds openly declaring at the peril of their lives
their belief in the despised Jesus, the strangely
rare unselfishness even in money matters, and
the winsome graciousness of spirit that marked,
not only the inner circle, but these greatly
increased crowds,&mdash;all this said one thing in
clear unanswerable tones of unmistakable power,
<i>Christ is crowned</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><span class="snlabel">[4]</span> For the sending down
of the Holy Spirit was the act of the crowned
Christ.</p>

<p>And every touch of the Holy Spirit's presence
within trusting hearts,&mdash;the sweet peace, the quiet
assurance, the longing for purity, the drawing
away to prayer, the hunger for God's Word,
the intense desire to have others saved, the passion
to please this wondrous God of ours,&mdash;all
these simple marks of the Holy Spirit's presence
in our hearts, all tell us, and each tells us, in
unmistakable tones, that Christ is crowned. For
this wondrous Spirit within is the gift of the
crowned Christ.</p>

<p>When Jesus went up from the earth, holding
as His sure captive the captivity of suffering
and death to which He had with such great
strength yielded, He received gifts, coronation
gifts. The Father gave Him all. He gave Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</a></span>
the disposal and control of all. This was the
crowning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[5] Psalm lxviii. 18; Ephesians iv. 8; Acts ii. 33.</p></div><p>And in His great out-reaching love Christ received
these gifts <i>on behalf of men</i>, His blood
brothers. And at once He gave to men, to His
trusting disciples, the all-inclusive gift, the Holy
Spirit, His coronation gift.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><span class="snlabel">[5]</span> So God came anew
to dwell with men as originally planned.</p>

<p>This blessed Presence within tells me, by His
mere presence, that Christ is crowned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[6] Romans viii. 34; Ephesians i. 20-22; Philippians ii.
9-11; Colossians iii. 1.</p><p>[7] I Peter iii. 22.</p></div><p>The writers of the New Testament make a
chorus of sweet music on this chord, ringing
out in clear tones the full notes of delight and
joy. Luke's simple narrative sounds the note
four times. Paul swells it out with a joyous fulness
that grows in volume and intensity as his
narrowing prison walls shut out more and more
the lower lights, and centres his upward gaze
upon Jesus, &quot;far above all rule, and authority,
and power, and dominion, and every name that
is named,&quot; with &quot;all things in subjection under
His feet.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><span class="snlabel">[6]</span> John's special companion and working
partner, Peter, makes this note blend with and
dominate the minor chord of suffering for
Christ's sake.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><span class="snlabel">[7]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[8] Hebrews i. 3; ii. 8-9; viii. 1; x. 12; xii. 2.</p></div><p>The Christian Hebrew who wrote so eloquently
to his fellow-countrymen of the immense superiority
of Jesus and so modestly withheld his own
name, strikes this note five times with strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</a></span>
clear touch.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><span class="snlabel">[8]</span> He quotes that Eighth Psalm,
which so wonderfully gives God's own ideal for
man's mastery over all creation. And then he
tells us that in Jesus the ideal will yet be fully
realized. And that while the whole plan has not
yet fully worked out as it will, yet <i>even now</i> we
see the Jesus who tasted death for every one,
crowned with glory and honour as part of the
plan which He carried out in suffering the extreme
suffering of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[9] Revelation iii. 21.</p></div><p>And our Lord Jesus Himself, talking out of
the glory to the man who was His bosom companion
on earth, reserves as His last tender plea
to us to live the overcoming life this&mdash;&quot;he that
overcometh I will give him to sit down with me
in my throne as I also overcame and <i>sat
down with my Father on His throne</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><span class="snlabel">[9]</span></p>

<p>And so we find out just what this word
crowned means. Jesus was received in the upper
world, exalted, glorified, made to sit down at the
Father's right hand, put far above all rule and
authority, with a name greater in the sweep of
its power than any other, and with all things
put in absolute subjection under His feet. This
is the simple, direct meaning of the sentence&mdash;Christ
is crowned.</p>

<p>What a contrast the two faces of that glory
cloud saw! The face looking down, and the face
looking up! The one&mdash;the downward face&mdash;looked
upon a cross, a Man hanging there with
a mocking crown of thorns without and a break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</a></span>ing
heart within, scowling priests, jeering crowds,
deserting disciples, sneering soldiers, weeping
women, heart-broken friends, a horror of darkness,
a cave-tomb under imperial seal, and blackest
night settling down over all.</p>

<p>The other&mdash;the upward face&mdash;looked upon a
great burst of the upper glory, the countless
angels singing swelling songs of worship, the
wondrous winged cherubim, the redeemed hosts
from Eden days on reverently bowing and exultantly
singing, the exquisitely soft-green-rainbow-circled
throne, the Father's face, once hidden,
but to be hidden now never again, the <i>shared</i>
seat on the Father's throne,&mdash;what a contrast!</p>

<p>Here crucified&mdash;there crowned. Crucified on
earth, one of the smaller globes of the universe.
On the throne of the whole universe of globes&mdash;crowned!
From the lowest depth to the one extreme
height. From hate's worst to Love's best.
From love poured out for men to love enthroned
for those same men; love triumphant each time,
on cross and on throne. What a contrast! What
a coronation! What a welcome home to a
throne!</p>

<h4>The Music of a Name.</h4>

<p>It is most intensely interesting to recall that,
of course, this is just what the very word Christ
means,&mdash;the Crowned One. We sometimes get
so used to a word that it is easy to forget its
real meaning. The word Christ has been used so
generally for so many centuries as a <i>name</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</a></span>
we forget that originally it was a title, and not a
name.</p>

<p>And it still is a title, though used chiefly as a
name. Some day the title-meaning will overlap
the name-meaning. We may never cease thinking
of it as a name, but there is a time coming
when events will make the title-meaning so big
as to clear over-shadow our thought and use of it
as a name.</p>

<p>It helps to recall the distinctive meaning of
the words we use for Him who walked amongst,
and was one of us. Jesus is His <i>name</i>. It belongs
to the <i>man</i>. It belongs peculiarly to the
thirty-three years and a bit more that He was
here, even though not exclusively used in that
way in the Book.</p>

<p>There's a rare threefold sweetness of meaning
in that five-lettered name. There is the
meaning of the old word lying within the
name, before it became a name, victory, victor,
saviour-victor, Jehovah-victor. There is the
swing and rhythm and murmur of music, glad
joyous music, in its very beginnings as a common
word.</p>

<p>Then it has come to stand wholly for a <i>personality</i>,
the rarely gentle, winsome, strong
personality of the Man of Bethlehem and Nazareth,
and of those crowded service-days. And
every memory of His personality sweetens and
enriches the music in the old word.</p>

<p>And then the deepest significance, the richest
rhythm, the sweetest melody, come from the
meaning His experiences, His life, pressed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</a></span>
it. The sympathy, the suffering, the wilderness,
the Cross, the Resurrection, all the experiences
He went through, these give to this victory-word,
Jesus, a meaning unknown before. They
put the name Jesus actually above every name
in the experiences of tense conflict and sweeping
victory it stands for. This threefold chording
makes music never to be broken nor forgotten.</p>

<p>
&quot;There is no name so sweet on earth,<br />
<span class="i1">No name so sweet in heaven,</span><br />
The name before His wondrous birth,<br />
<span class="i1">To Christ the Saviour given.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[10] Acts ii. 36.</p><p>[11] Romans x. 9.</p></div><p>Lord is a title, of course. It was used of one
who was a proprietor, an owner, or a master. It
was commonly used as a title of honour for one
in superior position, as a leader or teacher. In
speaking of Jesus it is coupled with the title
Christ as an interchangeable word,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><span class="snlabel">[10]</span> as well as
an additional title. But peculiarly it is the <i>personal
title</i> given Jesus by one who takes Him
as his own personal Master,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><span class="snlabel">[11]</span> while it still retains
its broader meaning.</p>

<p>But <i>Christ</i> is peculiarly <i>the official title</i> of
Jesus. There is only one Christ. Lord is used
of men. It is used of both the Father and the
Holy Spirit, as well as of Jesus. But the name
Christ is used of only one person, and can mean
only that one. There could be only one Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[12] I Samuel xvi. 6; xxiv. 6, 10; II Samuel i. 14-16;
xix. 21, and elsewhere; Psalm xviii. 50, and frequently
in Psalms.</p></div><p>The word or its equivalent was used occasionally
in the Old Testament in a narrowed sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page 18]</a></span>
for the King of Israel, who is reverently spoken
of as &quot;the Lord's anointed,&quot; that is, God's Messiah
or Christ.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><span class="snlabel">[12]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[13] John i. 20, 25; Luke iii. 15.</p></div><p>But the one common thought of it among the
Hebrew people, growing ever intenser as the Old
Testament period merges into the time of the
New, was that there was one coming, <i>the</i> Messiah,
<i>the</i> Christ, God's chosen, the one anointed
and empowered, to be their Deliverer. The one
question that sets all hearts a-flutter about the
rugged John of the deserts was this: &quot;Is he <i>the</i>
Christ?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><span class="snlabel">[13]</span> In their thought there was only one
to whom the title belonged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[14] Philippians ii. 10; I Corinthians xv. 24-26.</p></div><p>And even so it is. Christ is the official title
of <i>the One</i> Chosen and anointed by God to be
ruler over His Hebrew people, and over all the
race, and the earth, and the universe,&mdash;God's
King, to reign until all have been brought into
full allegiance to the great loving Father.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><span class="snlabel">[14]</span> The
Christ is the Crowned One, God's Crowned One.
The very word Christ tells that Christ is
crowned.</p>

<h4>Our Great Kinsman.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[15] John xvii. 5; i. 1-3; Colossians i. 15-17.</p></div><p>There is an intensely interesting question that
crowds its way in here, and it proves an immensely
practical question, too. <i>Why</i> was Christ
crowned? We can say at once that this was His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</a></span>
due. He was given that which belonged to Him
in good right. He was reinstated in His former
position, with all the power and glory that were
His before His errand to the earth.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><span class="snlabel">[15]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[16] Matthew xxvi. 64; Acts ii. 22-24, 32-36; Philippians
ii. 9-11; Hebrews ii. 9.</p></div><p>Then too this was His vindication after the
shameful treatment of earth. Before the eyes of
all the upper world, both loyal and disloyal eyes,
this man whom earth hounded so shamelessly is
vindicated; He is set right by the Father.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><span class="snlabel">[16]</span></p>

<p>But there is yet more than this. It is a more of
a sort that concerns <i>us</i> very closely, and it sets
one's heart a-beating a bit faster. This crowning
was part of a plan, a plan of which our earth
is the centre. It was the second great part of
a plan of which the suffering and dying were the
first great part. Both were for the sake of us
men and our earth-home, and the lower creation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[17] Hebrews ii. 5-18.</p></div><p>This is the thing being emphasized in the second
great paragraph of the Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><span class="snlabel">[17]</span> Man was
made the under-master of the earth and of the
lower creation, but lost, weakly surrendered, his
place of mastery. The new Man came to recover
for man what had been lost and to realize
this original lost plan.</p>

<p>And so He became our brother, sharer of our
flesh and blood, tempted like as we, perfected
in His human character by the experiences He
went through, then tasted to the bitter dregs the
death that belongs to our sin. And then follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</a></span>ing
that, He was crowned with glory and honour.
And so He rises to the place of mastery
over all that belongs to perfect man. So He
brings all creation into the glad subjection
which is its natural happy state. It is for
earth's sake, for the race's sake, and for the
sake of our faithful companions and servants,
the whole lower creation, that Christ has been
crowned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[18] Romans vii. 19-22; Jeremiah ix. 10; xii. 4, 11; xxiii.
10; Genesis iii. 17-19; Acts iii. 21.</p></div><p>We think more about the personal meaning to
ourselves of His having died and risen again.
We need to remember, too, this broader meaning.
The dying and rising secures our salvation personally.
The crowning and the reigning will
work out the redemption of all nature and of the
lower creation,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><span class="snlabel">[18]</span> and this in turn will mean much
for men living on the earth in the Kingdom time,
and for the race as a race.</p>

<p>This leads at once to another question that
presses in. What is the <i>domain</i> of the crowned
Christ? If we take the crowning in the common
meaning of that word, it means that there
is some domain that Christ rules over. What
is it that He is crowned over?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[19] Ephesians i. 20-22; Hebrews ii. 6-8.</p></div><p>And the answer is so sweeping as to seem
far-away and dreamy to us who are living on this
sin-hurt earth. He is the crowned Ruler of the
whole created universe and all intelligent beings
in it. He has been placed over absolutely every
&quot;rule and authority and power and dominion,
and not only in this present age but in the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</a></span>ing
age.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><span class="snlabel">[19]</span> There is simply no limit in extent
to His domain. Everything has been placed in
subjection to Him and is now subject to His
word, and His alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[20] Philippians ii. 9-11.</p></div><p>There is a striking passage in Philippians that
fits in here.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><span class="snlabel">[20]</span> In speaking of the exaltation of
Jesus Christ, Paul is careful to explain particularly
that every knee would bow, <i>in the heavens</i>,
and, <i>on the earth</i>, and <i>under</i> the earth or in the
<i>world below</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[21] Ephesians vi. 12; Colossians ii. 15.</p><p>[22] Colossians ii. 10; Ephesians iii. 10; iv. 8-10;
I Corinthians xv. 24.</p></div><p>This threefold division is very striking. The
heaven things are understood at once, and things
of the earth sphere. But there is a third world
to be taken into account, that strange uncanny
world of evil spirit beings in rebellion against
God's authority. It is spoken of repeatedly as
principalities and powers, indicating numbers and
organization, dignity, and power.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><span class="snlabel">[21]</span> All of this is
included in what has been placed under Christ's
authority.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><span class="snlabel">[22]</span></p>

<h4>Is Christ Reigning Now?</h4>

<p>But there is still another question that has been
impatiently pushing underneath for some time.
And it also is an intensely practical one. Does
this mean that Christ is actually ruling now over
this domain of His? How about the affairs on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page 22]</a></span>
the earth? Are all things here subject to Him?
Is this the way He would have things go? And
some of us think the evil spirits seem pretty free
in their movements. This present order of things
that we are living in the thick of, is this the reign
of the crowned Christ? And some of us feel the
stress of things so much that we can scarce keep
patient for a thoughtful poised answer to our
questions.</p>

<p>There are those, and good earnest folk they
are, too, who tell us that Christ has come, and
is constantly coming, more and more, into our
common life. The higher ideals that are crowding
for expression, the more spiritual conceptions
of man and his brotherly relations, the constant
striving toward better civilization, the bettering of
the condition of the poor and less fortunate, the
increased recognition of men's rights in the complex
industrial world, the increasing effort to
correct evils by legislation, the great moral reforms
that are sweeping aside the awful liquor
curse, and loosening women's bonds, and safeguarding
young womanhood and children, the
newer aggressiveness in the missionary propaganda
and in much of the activity of the Church,
even the attempt to humanize and civilize the
warfare that in itself is stupidly savage and utterly
inhuman,&mdash;is not all this a coming of Christ
and of the Christ-spirit into our common life?
many ask.</p>

<p>And there is only one answer to such questions,
a strong emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; It surely is the
Christ-spirit that moves in all of this. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Page 23]</a></span>
coming of Christ; and a blessed coming, too.
There was nothing of this sort before the Christ-spirit
began to sweeten the world's life. And
there is none of it to-day except in those parts
of the world where the Christ-spirit influences
life.</p>

<p>But&mdash;there's a &quot;but&quot;&mdash;it proves a blessed but;
this is only a crumb or two falling from a loaded
table. And he who judges Christ by these
crumbs only, wholesome and toothsome as they
are, will have a very skimpy conception of
Christ.</p>

<p>All of this sort of thing that has come has come
very slowly. It has had to fight through and
in, every step of the way that it has come. Its
coming has been opposed stubbornly, maliciously,
viciously every inch of the road, as only those
know who are in the thick of the struggle for
these reforms, panting for breath sometimes.</p>

<p>It is as though a few whiffs of wholesome life-giving
air have breathed through the cracks and
crevices of the breastworks and fortifications of
evil in which all our common life seems entrenched.
But the fortifications are still there.
If the sweet, wholesome breathing in through
cracks and crannies has been so blest, what would
it be if the forces of evil were clean removed
from the scene, and the Christ-spirit became the
whole atmosphere breathed fully and freely without
restraint, with no bad draughts, and no counter
currents to guard and fight against?</p>

<p>It would seem like a strange sort of a kingdom
if the present is even a gradual coming in of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</a></span>
the Kingdom. We would seem to be having a
new, strange sort of a Christ if the present is a
sample of His sort of reigning. For it may well
be thoughtfully doubted if ever there was such
a condition of feverish unrest in all parts of the
world as to-day.</p>

<p>It is most difficult to put your finger on a single
spot of the world-map that is not being torn
and uptorn by unrest in one shape or another.
Either actual war, or constant studious preparation
for war, actually never ceases. And it is
difficult to say which is the worse of the two.
The actual war reveals more terribly to our eyes
and ears the awful cost in treasure and in precious
human blood spilled without stint. The
never-ceasing preparation for war seems actually
to cost more. In the immense treasure involved,
and in blood too, given out, not on an occasional
battlefield, but in the continual battle of daily life
to meet the terrible drain of taxation, it costs immensely
more. There is less of the tragic for
the news headings, but not a whit less, rather
much more, in the slow suffering, the pinched
lives, and the awful temptations to barter character
for bread.</p>

<p>Then there is the continual seething unrest
in the industrial world; the protests sometimes
so strange and startling against social and political
conditions; the feverish greed for gold, and land,
and position; the intense pace of all our modern
life; the abandonment of home and home ideals;
the terrific attack against our young womanhood.
The political pot which gathers into itself all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</a></span>
these things, never quits boiling or boiling over,
in some part of the world, now here, now there.
And it seems like the greatest achievement of
diplomacy when here and there it can be kept
from boiling clean over, or at least made to boil
over less.</p>

<p>It would seem indeed like a queer sort of
kingdom if this is a sample. Some of us would
have less heart in repeating one petition of the
old daily prayer. And Christ would seem to have
quite changed His spirit and character if this is
a result of His coming.</p>

<h4>The Greatness of Patience.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[23] Hebrews ii. 8.</p></div><p>And the great simple truth is this, the truth
that in the strange mix-up of life we easily lose
sight of is this: <i>Christ has not yet taken possession
of all of His domain</i>; a part of it still remains
to be possessed. &quot;We see <i>not yet</i> all things subjected
to Him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><span class="snlabel">[23]</span> We are living in the &quot;not-yet&quot;
interval between the crowning and the
actual reigning. We are living on the &quot;not-yet&quot;
possessed part of His domain.</p>

<p>And the question that comes hot and quick
from our lips, even though with an attempt at
subdued reverence, is this: &quot;Why does He not
take possession, and untangle the snarl, and right
the wrongs, and bring in the true rational order
of things?&quot; And all the long waiting, the soreness
of hearts over the part that touches one's
own life most closely, the shortness of breath in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</a></span>
the tensity of the struggle, underscore that word
&quot;why?&quot;</p>

<p>And the answer to the impatient question reveals
all afresh the greatness of the love of our
Christ. His greatness is shown most in His
<i>patience</i>. But patience is one of the things we
men on this old earth don't know. It's one of
the unknown quantities to us. It can be known
only by knowing God. For patience is love at
its best. Patience is God at His best. His is
the patience that sees all, and feels all with the
tender heart that broke once under the load, and
yet waits, steadily waits, and then waits just a
bit longer.</p>

<p>In this He runs the risk of being misunderstood.
Men in their stupidity constantly mistake
strong patience for weakness or indifference
or lack of a gripping purpose. And God is
misunderstood in this, even by His trusting children.
But, even so, the object to be gained is
so great, and so near Christ's heart that He
waits, strongly waits with a patience beyond our
comprehension; waits just a bit longer, always
just a bit longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[24] II Peter iii. 8-9; Romans ii. 4; ix. 22; Revelation
ii. 21; I Peter iii. 20; II Peter iii. 15; Exodus xxxiv.
6-7.</p></div><p>There are two parts to the answer. Jesus the
Christ is giving man the fullest opportunity. He
never interferes with man's right of free choice.
Man is free to do as he chooses. Every possible
means is used to influence him to choose right, but
the choice itself is always left to the man. The
present is man's opportunity. The initiative of
action on the earth is altogether in man's hand.
All of God's power is at man's disposal; but man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Page 27]</a></span>
must <i>reach out</i> and <i>take</i>. This long stretched
but waiting time is for man's sake, that he may
have fullest opportunity. The longsuffering of
God would woo men.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><span class="snlabel">[24]</span></p>

<p>When at length opportunity comes to its end
it will be only because things have gotten into
such desperate shape, into such an awful fix, that
at length <i>for man's sake</i> Christ will step into the
direct action of the earth once again. He will
take the leadership of earth into His own hands,
even while still leaving each man free in his
individual choice. This is the first part of the
answer. The waiting is that man may have fullest
opportunity.</p>

<p>Then Christ has a great hunger for <i>willing</i>
hearts. No words are strong enough to tell His
longing for a free, glad, joyous surrender to His
mastery. He could so easily end the present conflict,
but He waits that men may bring to Him
the allegiance of their lives, given of their own
glad, gracious, voluntary accord. He was a volunteer
Saviour. He longs for that love that is
the bubbling out of a free, full heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[25] James v. 7.</p></div><p>The best love is only given freely without any
compulsion of any sort, save only love's sweet
compelling. He wants what He gives&mdash;the best.
And so He waits, patiently waits just a bit longer.
This is the second bit of the answer. The long
delay spells out the hunger as well as the patience
of God's heart. The divine Husbandman is pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</a></span>tiently
waiting, and sending warm sun and soft
rains and fragrant dews while waiting.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><span class="snlabel">[25]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><p class="stanza">
&quot;The Husbandman waiteth&mdash;<br />

</p></div>

<h4>Taking with Your Life.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[27] Ephesians i. 20-22.</p></div><p>But&mdash;ah! listen, there's a wonderful &quot;but&quot; to
put in here. But, while waiting <i>He puts all His
limitless power at our disposal</i>. If that simple
sentence could be put into letters of living flame,
its tremendous meaning might burn into our
hearts. When Paul piled up phrase on phrase
in his eager attempt to have his Asiatic friends
in and around Ephesus take in the limitless power
of the ascended Christ, he added the significant
words, &quot;to the Church.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><span class="snlabel">[27]</span> All that power is for
the use, and at the disposal, of the Church.</p>

<p>The Church was meant to be a unit in spirit
in loyalty to her absent Lord, wholly under the
dominating touch of the Holy Spirit, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</a></span>
in her official actions, but in the lives of the individual
members. If she were so, no human
imagination could take in the startling, revolutionary
power, softly, subtly, but with resistless
sweep, flowing down from the crowned Christ,
among grateful men.</p>

<p>Not being such a unit it is not possible that that
power shall be as great in manifestation as was
planned and meant. For no individual nor group
can ever take the place in action of the whole
unified body of believers, acting as a channel
for the power of the crowned Christ. That power
shall be realized on the earth only when the
Church is so unified, and at work, under the
reigning Christ, from the new headquarters up
in the heavens.</p>

<p>But meanwhile all of that power is <i>at the disposal
of any disciple of Christ</i>&mdash;the humblest&mdash;who
will simply live in full-faced touch with
Christ, and who will <i>take</i> of that power as the
need comes, and as the sovereign Holy Spirit
leads.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[28] Ephesians iii. 20.</p></div><p>It is of this, this <i>personal</i> taking, that Paul is
speaking when he piles up that intense sentence:
&quot;able to do <i>exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think</i> according to <i>the power that worketh
in us</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><span class="snlabel">[28]</span> The great bother in Paul's day and
ever since, and now, is to get people to <i>take</i>. The
power is fairly a-tremble in the air at our very
finger-tips. And we go limping, crutching along
both bodily and mentally and in our spiritual
leanness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Page 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[29] John xiv. 12-14.</p></div><p>Those tremendous words of Jesus, &quot;because
I go unto the Father,&quot; with the whole passage in
which they occur,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><span class="snlabel">[29]</span> must be read in <i>the light shining
from the throne</i>. Only so can they be understood.
But then, so read, they begin to grip us,
and grip us hard, as we see what He really meant
and means.</p>

<p>He who has the warm, child-like touch of heart
with Jesus, that the word &quot;believeth&quot; stands for,
shall&mdash;as the Holy Spirit has full control&mdash;do the
same works as Jesus did, same in kind and in
degree, and then shall do even greater than Jesus
ever did. <i>Because</i> it is now the glorified crowned
Christ who is doing them through some child
of His, simple-hearted enough to let Him have
full control.</p>

<p>And the means through which He will do them
is simple, child-like, trusting, humble prayer. The
man using the power is on his knees. The lower
down he gets the more and more freely the power
flows down and out among men.</p>

<p>As one learns to keep in touch&mdash;learns it
slowly, stumblingly, with many a stupid fall, and
many a tremble and quiver&mdash;as he learns to keep
in simple touch with the crowned Christ he will
find <i>all</i> the power of that Christ coming with a
soft surging throb of life wherever needed. <i>We
may have all we can take.</i> But <i>the taking must
be with one's very life</i>. No mere earnest repeating
of a creed in Church service will avail here.
The repeating must be, syllable by syllable, with
feet and will, with hands and life, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</a></span>
daily tread where each step is stubbornly
contested.</p>

<p>This is the bit of truth for the waiting time.
This is the song to be singing in this present
&quot;not-yet&quot; interval. And the song will help cut
down the length of that &quot;not-yet,&quot; until the friction
of our lived faith shall wear off the &quot;not&quot;
and wipe out the &quot;yet,&quot; and we shall find the
crowned Christ a reigning Christ.</p>

<p>For some day this patient waiting crowned
Man will rise up from His seat at the Father's
right hand. He will step directly into the action
of earth once again. Man will have had his fullest
opportunity lengthened out to the last notch
of his possible use of it. Then we shall see the
crowned Christ quietly stepping in, taking matters
wholly into His own hands, and acting in all the
affairs of earth as the Crowned One. Then He
shall reign from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates
out to where the ends of the earth become
a common line on the other side. The
Kingdom will have come, for the King will be
reigning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[30] Hebrews x. 13.</p><p>[31] Acts iii. 21.</p></div><p>The night will be gone. The day has come.

<h4>Working by the Light of the Throne.</h4>

<p>But we are still in the &quot;not-yet&quot; interval. We
see not yet all things subject to Him. This is
still the waiting time. It is the pleading time
for Him. He pleads for the <i>personal crowning</i>
of Himself in our lives, that He may reign there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</a></span>
and He alone. This is our great opportunity.
We shall never see its like again, nor anywhere
else than on this earth.</p>

<p>In the reigning time that's coming this peculiar
opportunity of crowning Christ while He still is
absent and despised, this will be gone. In the
upper world they have no such opportunity.
There is no opposition there. Now and here is
the rarest opportunity to put this great waiting
patient Man on the throne of heart and life,
with possessions and ambitions and plans all in
subjection under His feet.</p>

lace. The old capital of the low countries of
Europe has long been famous for its lace. It
is of great interest to note the conditions under
which it is sometimes made. They are conditions
studiously prepared after long experience.
In one of the famous lace factories in Brussels
there are a number of small rooms devoted to the
making of some of the most delicate patterns.</p>

<p>Each room is just large enough for a single
worker, and is quite dark except for one narrow
window. The worker sits so that the stream
of light falls from above directly upon the threads,
while he himself sits in the darkness. The darkness
aids the workman's eyes to see better, and to
work more skilfully in the narrow line of clear
light centred on the delicate task. He weaves
in the upper light intensified by the surrounding
gloom, and does exquisite work.</p>

<p>There is a clear line of light <i>from a throne</i>
shining down into the darkness in which we sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</a></span>
and move. It shines from the face of a crowned
Man. In the light of that light we can see clearly
to do a difficult bit of crowning work,&mdash;to crown
the Christ in our lives and to keep Him crowned.</p>

<p>As our eyes follow that line of upper light we
may catch glimpses of His wondrous Face up
there in the glory. So we shall be steadied and
cheered in the darkness as we stick to our glad
crowning work. And so we shall move forward
on the calendar the day when that thin line of
light seen now only by watching eyes shall become
a burst of glory light seen by all eyes.</p>

<p>And this is the thing the crowned Christ is
asking of us during this waiting time, this &quot;not-yet&quot;
interval. He is counting on each of us
being faithful to Him, our absent Lord, in this.</p>

<h4>The Crowning Book.</h4>

<p>There is a <i>crown book</i> in this old Book of
God,&mdash;the Revelation of John. It is <i>the</i> crown
book, the only one. It is the crown book of the
sixty-six in two senses. It is the capping climax
of the whole revelation of God's Word. It gathers
up into itself in a peculiar way the dominant
characteristics of both the Hebrew Old and the
Greek New Testaments.</p>

<p>And it is the book of the Crown. The King
is in action. He Himself gives the message of
the book to John. He is seen stepping forward
to take possession of His realm. Then He takes
possession. He dispossesses the pretender. He
reigns over the earth. The Revelation of John is
the Crown book.</p>

<p>This is the peculiarity of the Revelation in
comparison with all the other books. Only here
is Christ seen exercising His crown rights. From
end to end of the Old Testament pages, His coming
is looked forward to, with an eager longing
that grows in intensity as the national failure
grows ever worse.</p>

<p>In the Gospels He comes, but not as He was
expected. He is heralded as King, and claims
to be King. He has all the graciousness of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</a></span>
King in ministering to the needs of the people,
and all the power of a King in His personal
touch. But He is rejected by the nation, and
goes to the Cross, yet still as a King,&mdash;a humiliated,
crucified King.</p>

<p>In the Acts He is the risen, glorified King
seated at the Father's right hand in glory, and
at work through His followers among men on
the earth. But it is always in the midst of sharp,
bitter opposition. In the Epistles He is seen
crowned at the Father's right hand, guiding and
teaching His followers who are still suffering
persecution.</p>

<p>But in the Revelation of John all this is
changed. There's a sharp, decided, advance step.
Here He is not only crowned, but stepping directly
and decisively into the action of the earth
in the full exercise of His crowned rights and
power. It is peculiarly the book of the Crown,
the royal book, the enthroned Christ exercising
fully and freely at will His crown rights.</p>

<h4>Jesus' Bosom Friend.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[34] John i. 35-42.</p></div><p>The book was written by John the disciple and
apostle. This is our same old friend John, whom
we met first that ever-memorable afternoon, down
by the Jordan River road, when he was introduced
to Jesus by the John of the deserts, and
had his first long, quiet talk with Him.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><span class="snlabel">[34]</span> The
friendship began that day, grew steadily, and
never flagged. It was one of the few friendships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</a></span>
that Jesus had that never knew any lapse nor
eclipse.</p>

<p>He became, in an outstanding sense, the bosom
friend of Jesus. Probably it was not because of
any special gentleness or amiability on John's part,
though he may have had something of these traits.
It was more likely because of the deep, intelligent
sympathy between the two, a sympathy not only
of personality, but deeper and stronger because
of a mental and spirit likeness growing up between
them. It would seem likely that John developed
a mental grasp, a spirit insight, a student
thoughtfulness, a steadiness of temperament, and
with these, a growing understanding of much&mdash;at
the least&mdash;much of Jesus' spirit and ideals and
vision.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[35] Luke ix. 54.</p></div><p>It may quite be that all this came slowly, and
grew up out of the constant contact with Jesus,
and out of the warm personal love between the
two men; quite likely. Who could live so close
to Jesus as he and not bear the marks on mind
and spirit? The fire that burned so fiercely
in early years<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><span class="snlabel">[35]</span> grew into a steady, unflickering
flame under the influence of that personal friendship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[36] John xviii. 15-16.</p></div><p>It seems not unlikely that John belonged to a
good family, and had his home in Jerusalem. He
was clearly on terms of easy intimacy at the
palace of the High Priest,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><span class="snlabel">[36]</span> which in itself would
suggest his social standing in the city. It was to
this man that Jesus, on the Cross, committed the
care of His mother. And John accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</a></span>
trust as a tender token of friendship, and took
Mary at once to his own home. And as Mary
remained in Jerusalem at least some time, and
John clearly for a long time, the home was likely
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[37] Luke xxii. 8.</p><p>[38] Acts iii. 1, 3, 4, 11; iv. 13, 19; viii. 14, 25; Galatians
ii. 9.</p></div><p>John was one of the chief leaders in Jerusalem
during the Pentecost days, and after. Peter
was the chief spokesman, but John was always
close by his side. The friendship between the
two seems to have been close and of long standing.
They were sent together by the Master to
arrange for the supper that memorable betrayal
night,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><span class="snlabel">[37]</span> and they are seen together in the activities
in Jerusalem for many years.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><span class="snlabel">[38]</span></p>

<p>It would seem that in later years John left Jerusalem,
and made his home for the remainder
of his life in Ephesus. Doubtless he was led,
after the years of leadership in the mother
Church, to leave the great Jew centre, and devote
his strength to missionary service in the outside
Gentile world.</p>

<p>Ephesus was the chief city of the province of
Asia, and the natural centre of the population
and life of the province. John probably worked
out from Ephesus, preaching throughout the
whole district; teaching, advising, praying with,
and visiting the groups of little Churches scattered
throughout the province, perhaps founding
some, and strengthening all. For his work seems
to have been, not so much evangelizing, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Page 45]</a></span>
much more difficult work of teaching, patiently,
carefully, teaching; a work so essential to the life
of any Church. So he would be quite familiar
with the Churches to which the Revelation letters
are sent, and would be well known by these people
and loved and revered by them as a father in
the faith.</p>

<p>This personal bit about John is of intensest
interest in studying this book of his. It was
to this man that Jesus could entrust the writing
of this special message. John could take in what
the Master was showing him as few, if any others,
could. The close, sympathetic friendship
made him able to take in what his old Friend
and Master is now telling him in the glory. And
he could give it out too, simply, fully, clearly,
just as it was given to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[39] Mark xvi. 9; John xx. 1, 11-18.</p></div><p>Love can see and grasp, and can obey simply,
where mere mental keenness fails. There
is no tonic for the brain like love in the heart.
No brain ever does its best work, nor can, until
the heart is fired by some tender, noble passion.
It was to Mary Magdalene who had such reason
to love tenderly that Jesus showed Himself first
after the resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><span class="snlabel">[39]</span></p>

<p>And it is to John, the bosom friend, whose
friendship stood the severest test where all others
failed, that He now shows Himself in glory, and
entrusts this pleading message, and vision of coming
events, and of the after glory. He that willeth
to do the Master's will shall know surely
and clearly what that will is. And he that goeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Page 46]</a></span>
farther yet, and willeth to give the tenderest love
of his heart, ever kept at summer heat, shall know
the Master Himself, in present personal touch,
and in clear and clearing understanding of His
coming victorious action and crowning glory.</p>

<p>John wrote a Gospel; one chief Epistle, besides
the two very brief personal letters; and this book
of the Revelation. The Gospel and Epistles were
quite likely written while in Ephesus.</p>

<p>The Gospel was his plea to all men to whom
it might come to accept Jesus as their personal
Saviour. Its characteristic word is &quot;believe.&quot;
And the plan of it is a simple array of incidents
about Jesus that would lead men to a warm, intelligent
belief in Him.</p>

<p>The chief Epistle is written to the little groups
of believers scattered throughout Asia Minor,
and doubtless in the old home district of Judea,
too. Its characteristic word is &quot;abide.&quot; It is
an intense plea, by a personal friend to abide,
steadily, fully, in Christ, in spite of the growing
defections and difficulties pressing in so close.</p>

<p>The Revelation was written, quite likely, on the
island of Patmos while all was yet fresh in his
mind; or possibly in Ephesus after his release
from his island prison; or perhaps begun in
Patmos and put into its final shape in Ephesus.
It is written to the little groups of believers in
and near Ephesus. It is a most intense plea to
be personally true to the Lord Jesus in the midst
of subtle compromise and of bitter persecution.</p>

<p>Its characteristic word is &quot;overcome.&quot; It
speaks much of the opposition to be encountered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</a></span>
and tells of greater opposition yet to come, the
greatest ever known. And it pleads, with every
possible promise, and every warning of danger,
that the true believer set himself against the evil
tide, at every risk, and every possible personal
loss, and so that he &quot;overcome&quot; in the Name
of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<h4>Old and New Woven Together.</h4>

<p>The language in which the book is written is
of intense interest. It is so unusual. It combines
Hebrew thought and Greek speech. It is
as though a Hebrew soul were living in a Greek
body, and the soul has so dominated the body as
to make decided changes in it. The thought and
imagery, and the very words are largely taken
over from the Old Testament, much of it not
being found elsewhere in the New Testament. It
is as though the Old Testament reaches clear
over the intervening space and writes the last
book of the New as an additional book of the
Old, but with distinct additions. But all these
additions are outgrowths of what is already in
the Old.</p>

<p>But while the thought and imagery are Hebrew,
the language is Greek. But scholars note
that John's Greek here is different from that
of his Gospel, and is indeed peculiar to itself,
with new grammatical adjustments, as though
better to express his Hebrew thought. Yet, like
the Gospel, it is an easy Greek to learn and to
understand. It is as though the Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</a></span>
were the warp of a new bit of fabric, with the
New as the shuttle-threads, and yet with such
additions as makes the pattern stand out much
more definite and clear, and the colours in it
more pronounced. Thus this end-book is a weaving
of both Old and New into a new bit of
fabric, but with a more distinct pattern than
either.</p>

<p>This explains the use of the symbolism which
is so marked here. The picture language of
John's Revelation has seemed very puzzling. It
has seemed like a new language, to which we had
neither grammar nor dictionary, and the intended
meaning of which we could only guess at. But
this is because we are Westerners and a bit set
in our western way. And possibly, too, though
we dislike to confess it, because we have not
gotten a clear, simple grasp of this old Book of
God as a whole. The Bible is an Oriental book,
written in the characteristic picture language of
the Orient.</p>

<p>The truth is that the symbol or picture
language is meant to make the book <i>easier of
understanding</i>. We simply need to learn how to
read picture language, not whimsically, but sensibly
according to the laws of picture language. The
symbolism or picture sees things as they look at
the moment the picture is taken. The picture
is meant to give one general distinct impression
of the thing being presented, the details of
the picture being of value only as they give coloring
to that one general impression. It is concerned,
not at all, or only in the most incidental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</a></span>
way, with the process by which the thing came
to the point pictured.</p>

<p>There is a rare wisdom in the use of this picture
language. It is really the common language
not of the Orient merely, but of all the world.
In our western half of the globe it is the language
of the street, the common crowd, the common
exchange of life, and of children. It is the
language of the primitive peoples of all parts
of the world. Everywhere the conventionalized
book-language is spoken by the few. The picture,
with its companion, the story, is the universal,
the original, the natural language of the
race.</p>

<p>On the mere human side here is one secret
of the freshness of the Bible. It is the oldest
book in some of its parts, but admitted to be
the freshest and most modern in its adaptation
to modern life. And the reason is simple. The
pictures give <i>principles</i>. Principles don't change
with the changing of centuries. Rules change.
Principles abide. Details alter with every generation.
Principles of action are as unchangeable
as human nature, which is ever the same,
east and west, below the equator, and above.</p>

<p>John's Revelation is naturally full of this picture
language, for it is a gathering up of the
chief threads of the old Oriental Hebrew fabric.
It will help us understand the meaning if we keep
in mind the simple rules of this Hebrew picture
language.</p>

<p>John, of course, was a Hebrew, born and
bred in a Hebrew home, and immersed in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</a></span>
Hebrew Bible from the time of his mother's
milk. What Greek language and culture had
come was a bit of the outer world come into his
Hebrew home and life. Now in his old age the
early memory is asserting itself.</p>

<p>Then too it is quite likely that in his imprisonment
he had been brooding anew over the old
prophecies, reviewing afresh events since the
resurrection of Jesus,&mdash;the growth of the Church,
and now the severe persecution, with himself a
prisoner. And while he in no way doubts the
unseen overruling Hand, yet he is seeking to get
a fresh outlook into the future from the old
prophetic writings.</p>

<p>And through all of this without doubt the
Holy Spirit was brooding in unusual measure
over this man, reviving early memory, bringing
to his remembrance all things of other days,
deepening impressions, bringing old facts into
new perspective, giving clearer vision, mellowing
and maturing both mind and heart into fresh
plastic openness to further truth. And so we
have this little book with its Hebrew soul and
its Greek body.</p>

<p>The meaning of all this is very simple, and yet
a meaning of intense significance. Here is
summed up the whole of the revelation of God's
Word. Here all the lines of Revelation meet.
Almost two thousand years of inspiration come
to a climax in this little end-book. Psalmist and
prophet, historian and law-giver, Gospel and
Epistle come to a final focus point in one simple
intense message. The purpose of the book is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</a></span>tensely
and only practical. Here is the message
of the whole Bible to Christ's people <i>for this
present interval</i> between the Ascension and the
next great step in our Lord's world-plan.</p>

<h4>Jesus' Plea to His Friends.</h4>

<p>And the message is simply this: put to us with
all the intensity of the One who gave His very
life for us, it is this,&mdash;<i>that we be personally true
to our Lord Jesus</i> during His present absence.
This comes as His personal request, that, in sweet,
stern purity of life, in full glad obedience of
spirit, in tender freshness of personal devotion,
in holding absolutely everything, of talents and
position and possession, subject to His call, and
in keeping our eye ever open forward and upward
for His return, we be true to Him.</p>

<p>He is the Lamb slain. Only through His
blood is there salvation for any one. He is now
allowing man fullest opportunity before He comes
to set things right. This is the in-between time,
much lengthened out. In the midst of formalism
and subtle compromise, the tangling of ideas
and issues, and the blurring of vision within His
Church, He calls to His own blood-bought ones
to be true to Himself.</p>

<p>There's a terrific moral storm coming. Wickedness
will wax to a worst never yet known.
Evil will be so aggressive, compromise so radical,
temptations so subtle and coming with such a
rush, and ideals of right so blurred and dimmed
in the glare of the lower lights, that even those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</a></span>
of the inner circle will be sorely tried, and many
will be deceived. Just at the bursting of the
worst of the storm the crowned Christ will appear.
He will come on the clouds before all
eyes, take away His own out of the storm, then
clear the storm by His own touch, and begin
the new order of things.</p>

<p>The test coming will be terrific. He knows it.
And his knowledge makes His plea intense that
<i>we be true to Himself</i>, our beloved, crucified,
crowned Lord, utterly regardless of consequences
to ourselves. So we shall &quot;overcome by the
blood of the Lamb,&quot; and be joined with Him in
closest intimacy during His coming reign over
the earth.</p>

<p>There is a striking thing told us at the very
outset of the book;&mdash;it is a revelation. That is,
it is something revealed directly by God. It is
the only book of the Bible of which we are told
plainly and directly that it is a revelation.</p>

<p>It is not that the other books do not have the
same inspirational characteristic. But our attention
is explicitly called to the fact that this
one is, in its entirety, a <i>direct</i> revelation; and
not only so, but it is a revelation given directly
by God to the Lord Jesus, and given in person by
Him to John. This is significant. It marks out
the message of the book as of the utmost meaning
and importance.</p>

<p>This suggests a need. And the need of something
of the sort is plain enough, if one think
into it. Already in John's day there was a distinct
break-away from the simplicity and purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Page 53]</a></span>
of the Gospel, both in the Church and in the lives
of professed Christians. The messages to the
Churches of Pergamum and Thyatira and Sardis
show clearly that there had already begun a
rubbing out of the sharp line of distinction between
the Church and the world. The world
spirit was&mdash;not creeping in, but&mdash;walking boldly
into the life of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[40] I John ii. 18-29; iv. 1-6.</p></div><p>It is striking to note the thing that leads John
to write his First Epistle, that is, the alarming
conditions among Christ's followers. The spirit
of compromise seems seeping in at every crevice.
And worse yet, the spirit of Antichrist, that
makes such a savage attack on Jesus, on the
deity of His person, and the atoning significance
of His death, this was openly at work among
them.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><span class="snlabel">[40]</span> These conditions, so familiar to those
who first read his little Epistle, are the continual
underscoring of His intense plea for
<i>abiding</i>.</p>

<p>It is most significant that Jude's intense flame-like
Epistle talks entirely about conditions within
Church circles. Run through it again with
this fact fresh in mind, and the significance of
it stands out in a startling way. Peter's Second
Epistle reveals the same sort of an atmosphere
seeping in among the groups of disciples to
whom he writes. Not only was there doubt and
confusion about the meaning of the prophetic
teachings, but even a sneering and mocking at
the teaching about the second coming of our
Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</a></span></p>

<p>These are a few indications of how things were
in the Church generally before the first century
had closed. It was a time of confusion and compromise.
The air was tense. The need was
critical. It would seem that if ever our Lord
would give a simple direct revelation afresh, to
His people, it would be in just such circumstances.
And it reveals to us at once how
grave things looked to His eyes, and how much
depended on His followers having a clear understanding
of how things would work out, that our
Lord Jesus does do just this thing,&mdash;send a direct
revelation that would meet just such a
need.</p>

<h4>More Alike than Different.</h4>

<p>It is most striking that the conditions of the
Church then and to-day are so much alike. The
line between Church and world is either badly
blurred, or quite wiped out. And this one fact
throws a flood of light upon Church conditions.
Within the Church, when it comes to the matter
of what its real purpose of being is, and what the
essentials of faith, the lines are hopelessly
crossed and tangled, even though the surface
shows so much striving toward at least a seeming
unity, and so much aggressiveness in action.
The common absence of real spiritual power,
that unmistakable moving, like a breath, of the
Spirit of God, is freely admitted.</p>

<p>It is a painful fact that membership in a
Church no longer gives any clue to a man's vital
belief, nor even to his moral conduct. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</a></span>
utter confusion about the practical meaning of
God's prophetic Word, and what the actual
outcome of the present order will be; that is,
where such things are not quite dismissed from
consideration. And, stranger yet, indifference,
or an actual repugnance, to any mention of the
Lord's return is the common thing. It is not
surprising that earnest people are bewildered
as to just what should be the attitude of one
who would ring true to the absent Jesus. It
hurts to remember that all this is the freely admitted
commonplace, where such things are seriously
spoken of.</p>

<p>Indeed it is of intense interest to note that just
this sort of thing has marked the whole interval
since these early Church days. Broadly the same
characteristics have marked both world movement
and the Church movement in this long
interval. There is a unity characterizing the age
since our Lord ascended. There have been differences,
very sharp and marked, but always they
have been differences in degree, now more intense,
now less. The general characteristics have
been the same in kind.</p>

<p>The need of the Church in the end of the first
century is its need in the beginning of the twentieth.
Surely the thing of all things needed is
a simple, clear, understandable revelation direct
from our Lord Jesus Himself. It was needed
then. Clearly it has been needed in every generation
since then. And one whose pulse is at
all sensitive to spirit conditions to-day feels that
surely it is the thing needed now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</a></span></p>

<p>And here it is, a revelation of Himself,
crowned in the upper world, keeping in closest
touch with things down in this world, telling us
what the outcome is to be, and especially speaking
of our attitude toward Himself in this present
in-between interval.</p>

<p>Usually God's method with man is to give him
enough of a revelation of Himself in nature, and
in His Word, to start him straight, and guide
him as he goes to school with himself as chief
pupil, with all of nature to find out and develop,
and so to get mastery both of himself and of
nature and its forces. We recognize this as
the best school-teacher method for good self-development.</p>

<p>But here something more seems needed. The
situation down on the earth has gotten badly
mixed up. Even though Jesus has been on the
earth, and has died, and has sent down the Holy
Spirit in such irresistible power, the situation in
the world, and among His disciples, has gotten so
subtly tangled and intense, the enemy is so
viciously and cunningly at work, that only one
thing will meet the need,&mdash;a revelation, a simple,
direct, warm revelation given us personally by
the Lord Jesus Himself. And here it is in this
little end-book, with its vision of the glorified
Jesus, its pleading heart-cry to His followers, and
its simple but tremendous outlook into the future.</p>

<p>It would not be surprising if such a book should
be made the subject of special attack by the evil
one. It is not surprising, though it is deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</a></span>
grievous, that the common idea about this book
among Christian people is that it is a sort of a
puzzle, that it is impossible to get a simple, clear,
workable understanding of its message. Parts of
it are conned over tenderly and loved, a paragraph
here, a verse there, and so on, but a grasp
of the one simple message of the book seems not
common, to put it mildly. No book of the sixty-six
has seemed so much like a riddle to which
no one knew the answer. And without doubt the
full meaning of much will be quite clear only as
events work themselves out. Events will be the
best exposition of certain parts. But these parts,
be it keenly noted, are not essential to the grasp
of the whole message. God is intensely
practical. Jesus was too intent on helping people
to be otherwise than practical. He hasn't
changed. He is too tremendously wrapped up
in the outworking of His plans. The Bible is
wholly a <i>practical</i> book. And this crowning end
of it is intensely and only practical. It is with
the clear conviction that it is entirely possible to
get the simple grasp of it that shall steady our
steps, and clear our understanding, and feed our
personal devotion to the absent Jesus, our blessed
Lord, that these few simple quiet talks have been
put together.</p>

<h4>Doing Leads to Understanding.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[41] Revelation i. 1-3.</p><p>[42] Revelation i. 4-8.</p><p>[43] i. 9-20.</p></div><p>The outline of the book is very simple. After
the brief introduction<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><span class="snlabel">[41]</span> and personal greeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><span class="snlabel">[42]</span>
there comes the wondrous vision of <i>the glorified
Jesus</i>, and His personal message to John.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><span class="snlabel">[43]</span> He
is the Living One, who <i>became</i> dead for a great
purpose, and is now living, never to die again.
He is seen walking quietly among the groups of
his followers, with eyes of flame, and heart of
love, keeping watch over these, His empowered
witnesses on earth.</p>

<p>And He tells John that he is to write to the
groups of his followers a threefold message,
a description of Himself as just now seen by
John, a description of affairs in these Churches
as seen by His own eyes, and an account of
the things that are going to happen on the
earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[44] Chapters ii. and iii.</p><p>[45] Chapters iv. and v.</p></div><p>Then follows this description of the Churches.
It is in a sevenfold personal message to His
followers on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><span class="snlabel">[44]</span> Then the vision of
Himself in heaven as He steps directly into the
action of the earth to take possession of His
crown domain.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><span class="snlabel">[45]</span> Then comes the account of
coming happenings. It is a sevenfold view of a
terrific moral storm on the earth, that will follow
this advance step of His in the heavens. It is so
terrific and includes so much, that it is possible
to get a clear view of it and its sweep only by
looking, now at this feature of it, and now at
this; now from this angle of vision, and now
from this other.</p>

<p>It is the final contesting of Christ's crown
claim as He steps forward to assert it; the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</a></span>
outburst of evil unrestrainedly storming itself
out. And it is the clearing-up storm, too. There
is ever the shining of a clear light just beyond
the outer rim of the terrible blackness of the
storm clouds. This takes up the greater part
of the little book, including chapter six, to the
close of chapter eighteen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[46] xix. i-xx. 3.</p><p>[47] xx. 4-6.</p><p>[48] xx. 7-15.</p><p>[49] xxi. i-xxii. 5.</p><p>[50] xxii. 6-21.</p></div><p>And then there is given briefly the actual coming
to earth in glory of the crowned Christ;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><span class="snlabel">[46]</span>
the new order of things under His personal
reign;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><span class="snlabel">[47]</span> a final crisis;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><span class="snlabel">[48]</span> and then in a vision of
wondrous winsomeness, God and men are seen
dwelling together as one reunited family, though
still with a sad burning reminder of the old sin-rebellion
as part of the picture.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><span class="snlabel">[49]</span> And the book
closes with personal paragraphs to John and to
the groups of Churches.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><span class="snlabel">[50]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[51] i. 3.</p></div><p>Another of the striking things peculiar to
this book is the personal plea that it be read
and lived up to. At the very front-door step as
one starts in he is met full in the face with this:
&quot;Blessed is <i>he</i> that <i>readeth</i>, and they that <i>hear</i>,
(or give careful heed to) the words of the
prophecy, and <i>keep</i> the things that are written
therein.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><span class="snlabel">[51]</span></p>

<p>Here at the very outset is a plea, made to
each one into whose hands the little book may
come, for a reading, and a careful thinking into,
and then, yet more, a bringing of the whole
life up to the line of what is found here.
The blessing of God will rest peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</a></span>
upon him who heeds this threefold plea.
That man is moving in the line of the plan of
God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[52] xvi. 15.</p></div><p>A little past the midway line of the book, all
at once, abruptly, in the thick of terrible happenings
being told, an unexpected voice comes.
Clearly it is the Lord Jesus Himself speaking. It
is as though He were standing by all the time
throughout all these pages, watching with a sleepless
concern. Now He speaks out. Listen:
&quot;Blessed is he that <i>watcheth</i>,&quot; that keepeth ever
on the alert against the subtle temptations, and
the compromise that fills the very air, &quot;and
<i>keepeth his garments</i>;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><span class="snlabel">[52]</span> sleeplessly, kneefully,
takes care that no breath of evil get into his heart,
no taint of compromise stain his life, no suspicion
of lukewarmness cool his personal devotion to
the absent Jesus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[53] xxii. 7.</p></div><p>And again, doing sentinel duty at the rear-end,
is the same plea. &quot;Blessed is he that <i>keepeth the
words</i> of the prophecy of this book.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><span class="snlabel">[53]</span> Reading,
heeding, obeying, watching, living up to, this is
the earnest plea peculiar to this book. Clearly
our Lord Jesus desires earnestly that it be read.
And He expects us to understand it. And He
pleads with us to live in the light of what He
tells us here.</p>

<p>He that willeth to do shall know what he ought
to do. He that doeth the thing he does know
will know more. And that more done will open
the door yet wider into all the fragrance of a
strongly obedient life, and into a clear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</a></span>
clearing understanding of the Lord Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>He that brings his life bit by bit up to the level
of the earnest plea of this special revelation, as
bit by bit it opens to him, will find his understanding
of it wonderfully clearing. Obedience is
the organ of understanding. Through it there
comes clear grasp of the truth.</p>

<p>A single recent illustration of this comes from
Korea, that land that gives us so much of the
romance of missions, as well as so much of its
pathos. Dr. James S. Gale, of Seoul, tells of a
Korean who had travelled some hundred miles
to confer with him about Christian things. He
recited to Dr. Gale the whole of the Sermon
on the Mount without slip or error. After
this surprising feat of memory, the missionary
said gently that memorizing was not
enough; the truth must be practised in daily
life.</p>

<p>To his surprise the Korean quietly said:
&quot;That's the way I <i>learned</i> to memorize. I tried
to memorize, but it wouldn't stick. So I hit upon
this plan; I would memorize a verse, then find a
heathen neighbour and practise the verse on him.
Then I found it would stick.&quot;</p>

<p>That's the <i>rule for understanding</i> this revelation
of Jesus through John, as well as all of this
inspired Word of God. This rule simply, faithfully,
followed will open up this little end-book
which to many has seemed a sealed book. He
that &quot;keepeth the things&quot; that are written here
will find these pages opening to his eyes. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</a></span>
that liveth the truth he does understand will
understand more and better, and so live in the
wondrous power of it, and in the sweet presence
of Him who gives it to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</a></span></p>
<h4>Transfigured by a Look.</h4>

<p>No one ever had a sight of Christ's face and
forgot. No one ever gets a sight of Him and
gets over it. He is never the same man after
that. He doesn't want to be the same.</p>

<p>A look into the face of Christ is transforming.
You see Him; and you can never be the man
you have been and be content. A change comes.
You want a change. You must have it. This
longing is the beginning of the deeper change.
You can never be content again with being the
man you have been.</p>

<p>It has always been so. It always will be so.
For this is the natural thing. In the dawning
twilight of Eden God looked into the face of the
man he had fashioned. He drew very close to
him, close enough to breathe his own breath into
his face. And the man looked out into God's face,
and took on God's likeness. So he became his
own real self, as originally planned.</p>

<p>But while man was yet young, sin looked him
in the face. And the man looked at sin with an
evil longing look. And in that look he took in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Page 66]</a></span>
some of what he saw. He was marred. The
God image was hurt. He was not the same man.
And he knew it. He felt it. His eyes were
never the same after that exchange of looks with
sin.</p>

<p>But God helped him. He didn't go away. He
came closer for the sake of the sin-hurt eyes.
And whenever man has looked into that wondrous
God-face, even though seeing dimly and
indistinctly, something within him makes a great
bound. He recognizes the original of his own
natural self. And he catches fire at the sight. A
holy discontent springs up within.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;Couldst thou in vision see<br />
<span class="i1">Thyself the man God meant,</span><br />
Thou never more couldst be<br />
<span class="i1">The man thou art&mdash;content.&quot;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>But you have to see Jesus as He was in His
humanity to see yourself the man God meant.
And you have to see Jesus as He is now to see
the God who meant you to be like Himself.</p>

<p>It has always been so. This has been God's
simple method with men He would use. He has
wooed and then wooed more, and a bit longer,
gently, persistently, up and away and apart
until at last the man's eyes were trained away
from the lower glare enough to see the real
things.</p>

<p>Then in some vision of the night, whose darkness
helped hold back the lower earth lights,
God has looked a man in the face once again. Or,
perhaps in open day there came to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</a></span>
which he could not describe. But in his inner
spirit he knew there was One with him whom
yet his outer eyes could not see, but who <i>could</i>
not be more real if his outer eyes did see.</p>

<p>And in that presence there was a mingling of
exquisite tenderness and of limitless power that
was overawing. Inconceivable purity and yet
such an unspeakable graciousness seemed blended
in this presence. And the man seeing was melted
in his innermost being with the sense of tenderness,
and bowed in awe to the lowest dust in
the sense of overwhelming power. Those who
have seen will understand how poor the words
are to tell the story. And those who have
not may wonder a bit until they, too, have
seen.</p>

<h4>Some Transfigured Men.</h4>

<p>This it was that transformed that man of the
early dawnlight named Enoch, the seventh from
Adam. He was the head of the leading family of
the race, the racial leader. He had lived well on
into the seventh decade of his life.</p>

<p>Then the change came. He recognized a
Presence with him, one day. That One unseen
by unseeing eyes became real to him and then
more real. He yielded to His wooing. He companioned
with Him daily. This came to be the
realest thing. And he was transformed by it.
He grew constantly less like what he had been,
and more like what he was originally meant to
be, like his Companion. Constant contact re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</a></span>stored
the original likeness. He was transformed
before men's eyes, changed over from
within.</p>

<p>Then one day the transforming forces had
gone so far that he was transferred to the upper
levels, where all <i>see His face</i>, and his likeness
shines out of all faces. He never got over the
sight that came to him that early day.</p>

<p>It was this that wooed the man of Ur away
from his ancestral home to be a lonely pilgrim, a
stranger among strangers. Nothing less or else
could have broken the early attachments, the
strongest of the East. That winsome wooing
Presence became to him stronger than the strongest
human attachments of his family and home
land.</p>

<p>This it was that steadied him through the
loneliness, the homelessness, the disappointments,
the long delays, until it was the image of
a new man, a transformed man, a faith-begotten
man, that at length looked at him out of the eyes
of his only begotten. This it was that steadied
him through the hardest test of all with that
only begotten, the fire test on Moriah. And that
made the transformation yet fuller. For so he
grew the liker him to whose presence he insisted
on yielding as each test came.</p>

<p>So it was with that rare student of Egypt and
Arabia. Trained in the best that man could give
in the University of the Nile, and then further
trained by absence from man in the University
of the Desert, alone with sheep and stars, shifting
sand and immovable rock, he wasn't ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</a></span>
his task yet. He was well trained but not yet
transformed.</p>

<p>The fires had to be kindled, purifying, melting,
fusing fires. And only fire kindles fire. The
fire of the unburnt bush told him first of a new
kind of fire, uncatalogued on the Nile. The fire
of a Presence burned daily, not consuming him,
but only the dross <i>in</i> him, as he led his race
from Egypt to Sinai, out from the slavery of men
up to the freedom of the presence of God. And
then for six weeks, twice over, he was in the
Presence of Flame on the Mount.</p>

<p>This it was that utterly changed him into the
strongly gentle, patient, tender-hearted, wise man
who taught and trained, lived with and led, the
immature men and women whom God would
weld into a nation, a God-nation. He never got
over those two long visits to the Mount, nor has
the world.</p>

<p>It was nothing else than this, long years later,
that made the rugged man of the deserts brave
the traitorous Ahab in his luxurious, licentious
court. Without it, the sight obscured, the vision
lost, he is a coward fleeing like a whipped dog
before a bad woman, thinking only of saving
his own skin. It showed himself, his weak,
cowardly self, to himself.</p>

<p>A fresh vision that early morning in the mouth
of the desert cave made the yet deeper more
radical transformation. That unutterably gentle
sound of stillness, too exquisite to be told, only
to be felt by a spirit in tune, <i>that</i> left him not a
whit less willing to brave danger than before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</a></span>
but made over now into another sort, like him
whose Presence in the cave so melted him down.</p>

<p>This new, gentled, mellowed, strengthened Elijah
reappears in the man who received the birthright
portion of his spirit. We know the new
Elijah by the spirit that swayed Elisha. The old
spirit, fiercely denouncing, calling down fire,
slaying the priests, but with no grief-broken heart
under these stern needful things,&mdash;this we think
of familiarly as the Elijah spirit.</p>

<p>The new spirit, healing, teaching, sympathizing,
leading, feeding, fathering, the greatness of gentleness
and patience, these characteristics of Elijah's
prophetic heir tell of the deep radical transformation
by the wondrous unseen Presence that
early morning in the mouth of the cave. This is
the birthright gift of Elijah to Elisha. Elijah
had a spirit-sight of God, and he never got over
it. He became like Him into whose face he
looked.</p>

<h4>Heart Stimulant for the Brain.</h4>

<p>But time fails, and words fail immensely more,
to tell this thing. Let him who would know that
transforming sight get quietly alone with Isaiah
in the temple, and on bent knees linger unhurriedly,
and listen, and watch, and breathe out his
prayer, and strongly wait until something of
the same brooding Presence be discerned that
transformed this young Hebrew messenger of
God.</p>

<p>Then let him get alone with the Moses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Page 71]</a></span>
New Testament. For there is no man who was
so utterly transformed, and so quickly, as the
man on the Damascus road. The whole course
of his character and life was radically changed
as by a lightning touch. This is the most striking
illustration of all. No man so reveals in himself
the tremendous transforming power there
is in the sight of the Christ as does this high-strung
son of the Hebrew race.</p>

<p>But&mdash;words are such lame things. They cannot
tell the story here. They are all one has
to use. Yet they'll never be understood except
as the light of experience shines upon them.
When any one attempts to talk of such a thing as
this of seeing God or Christ, his words seem so
poor and lame and under the mark by the man
who has had something of the vision. And they
either are meaningless and uninteresting, or else
they seem overstated, and quite beyond the mark
to one who has had no inkling in experience of
the thing itself.</p>

<p>I recall distinctly the experience of a Danish
friend in Copenhagen. She had been trying to
read in English a certain devotional book, but
said she couldn't seem to grasp the meaning of
the English words. They eluded her, and so the
book didn't help her much.</p>

<p>Then she went through a time of sore stress
of spirit in the sickness and death of her mother.
A new experience of the nearness of God came
to her. And then happening&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;to
pick up the English book again she was amazed
and delighted to find how much better and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</a></span>
quickly she knew the words and sensed the meaning.</p>

<p>It is only as the heart is fired that the brain
awakens. Experience gives the meaning to language.
Without experience it is a dead language
in meaning even though it be one's own mother
tongue. Only the man who has caught something
of the vision of Christ's face can understand
the strong words used in talking of such
a vision.</p>

<p>It is most striking to notice that even when
the glory of God's presence was hidden beneath
human wrappings in Jesus it still could be <i>felt</i>.
Men felt that presence though they knew not
just what it was they felt, nor why. When the
glory came yet closer in the coming of Jesus, it
must be well covered up for the sake of men's
eyes, that they might not go blind at once; but
its power of attraction could not be wholly hid.</p>

<p>So really human was Jesus in the outer circumstance
of His life that His brothers of the
home couldn't believe he was essentially different
from themselves. But the attraction of that
presence was felt constantly even through the
human hiding of it.</p>

<p>John of the Wilderness instinctively recognized
that here was more than the man he saw,
and so obeyed His word. The crowds gathered
eagerly in the Jordan bottoms in even greater
numbers than to hear John, drawn by a power
they felt they must yield to, and did yield to
gladly.</p>

<p>From the first the crowds gathered thick about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Page 73]</a></span>
Him, Jewish aristocrat, Samaritan half-breed
and sinful outcast jostling elbows in their eagerness
to hear, drawn by a power they could feel,
but could not understand any more than they
could withstand it. The children loved his presence
and touch.</p>

<p>The bad in life were as resistlessly drawn up
to a new life as the Greeks were drawn from
clear beyond the blue waters of the Hellespont
into His presence. The crowds were irresistibly
drawn to follow on that last eventful
journey to Jerusalem even while they felt
&quot;afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the sight of the glory on the Mount
that drew faithful John in <i>with</i> Jesus, and held
him steady that awful night in palace and courtyard,
and that later brought poor blasphemous
Peter back for forgiveness. The two walking to
Emmaus found their hearts all aflame, though
they supposed it was only the chance stranger
of the roadway they listened to.</p>

<p>Even those who hated Him were compelled to
recognize the wondrous power of His presence.
The Nazareth hands that itched to seize Him
were restrained by His presence as He passed
through their midst. Ten times did the Jerusalem
crowds attempt his life, and ten times were
they restrained by a power in Him that they
could neither understand nor withstand.</p>

<p>The men officially empowered to arrest Him
return empty-handed, confessing the overawing
power of His words. That last week the leaders
that were hotly plotting His death felt the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Page 74]</a></span>
restraint of His presence while He quietly sat
in their very midst, and swayed the crowds.</p>

<p>In the garden soldiers and priests alike were
felled to the ground by the power of His presence.
So it always has been. No one has ever
had a sight of that Face, and gotten used to it,
or gotten over it.</p>

<h4>A Fresh Vision Needed.</h4>

<p>But the thing we are specially needing to-day
is a sight of Christ <i>as He is now</i>. It seems a
bit strange that we don't get this more. One historic
Church has Him fastened to a cross, never
freed from the old fastenings. Another has Him
set in picture frame, behind glass. And the multitudes
prostrate themselves and reverently kiss
the glass.</p>

<p>In widely differing Churches He seems quite
covered up out of sight by classical ritual, beautiful
music, and impressive stately service. The
crowds gather and listen and bow low in hushed
stillness. But, apparently, <i>Him they see not</i>, else
how different their conduct as they come out, and
their lives.</p>

<p>And yet as I have mingled with the worshippers
in Catholic Churches in the south of Europe,
in Greek Churches in Russia, and in congregations
of the Church of England classed as &quot;high,&quot;
I have been caught by faces here and there in the
crowd that clearly were reaching out hungrily
for <i>Him</i>, and were having some sort, some real
sort, of touch with Him, too. Yet it seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Page 75]</a></span>
in spite of surroundings. The insistence of their
hunger pierces through these to Him. He seems
hidden from the crowd by them.</p>

<p>Scholarly orthodox theologians talk learnedly
about Him, but Himself as He walked among us
and as He is now, Him it would seem that they
see not, at least not enough to burn through and
burn out and burn up and send men out aflame
with the Jesus-passion. Philosophies about Him
that are classed as &quot;liberal&quot; and put attractively,
yet have nothing of the burn in them that reveals
Himself.</p>

<p>The more modern Church of the more western
world seems to have gotten a new lease of
aggressiveness in service, a new intensity in activities
so numerous as to be a bit bewildering
sometimes. The wheels whir busily and noisily.
You feel them. But Him, the unseen presence
that makes you reverently wrap your face up
out of sight, and stand with awed heart to listen,
<i>Him</i> we seem not to see.</p>

<p>The wondrous quiet Voice that makes your
heart burn within you with a burning that
cleanses and mellows and melts down, <i>that</i> we
seem to hear only by getting away from the noise
of the whirring wheels into some quiet corner.</p>

<p>There are in every Church and nation those
who seem to have the close personal touch with
Himself. Their faces and daily lives show the
marks. Their lips may not say so much, for they
who see most can say least of what they see. But
the marks in the life are unmistakable.</p>

<p>Yet even here the sight of Christ emphasizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</a></span>
chiefly the personal side, what He is personally
to them. And what a blessed side that is only
they who know it know. They think of Him as
a personal Saviour, and the heart glows. They
see Him at the Father's right hand interceding,
and gratefully remember that He will forget no
name where there is a trusting heart. They think
of the Holy Spirit, the other Jesus, Jesus' other
self, always &quot;alongside to help,&quot; alongside <i>in</i>side.
And they practise letting Him work out the
Christ-likeness within themselves.</p>

<p>And all this is blessed, only blessed. They see
Him in His personal relation to themselves. But
there's something more than this. No one knew
more of this blessed personal part than John.
But John saw more than this on Patmos. He saw
Christ <i>as He is now</i>.</p>

<p>This is clearly a new sight of Christ. It was
new to John. It would seem to be new to us.
It is new in the pages of this book. It is something
different from any sight seen before. In
the Gospels we see Jesus the <i>Man</i>. In carpenter
shop and little whitewashed stone cottage, in the
ministering life clear from the Jordan bottoms to
the healing touch at Gethsemane's gate, and in
the suffering clear up to the ninth hour of that
fateful day He is the <i>Man</i>, one of ourselves,
though clearly more even in His humanity than
the humanity we are.</p>

<p>On the Transfiguration Mount the favoured
inner three, the leaders, see the glory within
shining out through the Man. So bewildered are
they that the chief impression that remains is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Page 77]</a></span>
a blinding brightness. Yet this is up on a high
mountain far away from the crowd, and from
the haunts of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[55] Notably Ephesians i. 20-23.</p></div><p>As Stephen is being stoned his eyes are opened
to see the Son of Man standing in glory up at the
Father's right hand. The Damascus traveller
sees an overpowering burst of glory out of the
blue and hears a voice speaking. In the epistles
Paul pictures Him seated at the Father's right
hand with an authority greater than any other.
All the power He has is placed at the disposal of
His followers on the earth. He Himself is above
in the glory.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><span class="snlabel">[55]</span></p>

<p>But in this very end of the Book John is given
a <i>new sight of Christ</i>. He sees Him <i>as He is
now</i>. That is to say, this is the sight of Christ
as He is now <i>characteristically</i>. It is the distinctive
sight that stands out above all these others.</p>

<p>He <i>is</i> at one's right hand in closest personal
relation, through His Holy Spirit. He <i>is</i> at the
Father's right hand in glory waiting expectantly
till the time is ripe for the next direct move on
the earth. But there's more than these. There's
a sight of Him that overshadows these. It is
the characteristic sight that lets us see Him as
He is peculiarly <i>now</i> in His relation to <i>affairs on
the earth</i>.</p>

<h4>Christ as He Is Now.</h4>

<p>This new sight of Christ is the heart and soul
of this crowning book, this end-book of the Book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</a></span></p>

<p>It was out of this sight that this end-book
grew. It is written wholly under the spell of
this new sight of Christ. It is a revelation both
<i>of</i> Jesus Christ and <i>by</i> Jesus Christ; first of,
then by.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[56] Revelation i. 1-3.</p><p>[57] Revelation i. 4-8.</p></div><p>John begins his story by telling that he had
gotten such a revelation, and of the special blessing
attached to reading and fitting one's life to it.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><span class="snlabel">[56]</span>
Then follows his salutation to those for whom
the revelation was given, and the book written.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><span class="snlabel">[57]</span>
It is peculiarly a <i>Church</i> book. Its message is
not peculiarly for individual followers, but for
groups of believers gathered together as
Churches.</p>

<p>The salutation is absorbed with the One whom
he has seen in the vision, what He has done for
us in shedding His blood, and that He is actually
coming again. &quot;Behold He cometh with the
clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they
that pierced Him.&quot; The Jew is specifically designated:
the coming has special significance for
the Jewish nation. And all the people of the
earth shall penitently mourn as they see Him.
And then like an endorsing signature from the
One of whom he is writing comes the sentence:
&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord
God, who is and who was, and who cometh, the
Almighty One.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[58] Revelation i. 9-20.</p></div><p>Then comes the new sight of the crowned
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><span class="snlabel">[58]</span> It was on a Lord's day. John was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Page 79]</a></span>
the lonely sea-girt isle of Patmos. He was alone,
brooding probably over some bit of the Word of
God, and about the Jesus of whom he had been
so earnestly testifying. It was these that had
brought him to his lonely island prison. These
ever burned within him, the wondrous written
Word, the immensely more wondrous Word
made flesh, of whom he had written, the Word
that was God and became a Man and walked
the will of God.</p>

<p>And as he brooded he became conscious of the
Spirit of God overshadowing him, gentle as the
soft breeze, noiseless as the fragrant dew, mighty
as an enveloping presence that filled his being
and had possession of him.</p>

<p>Then a voice spake and the tone of authority
in it was unmistakable. &quot;What thou seest,
write.&quot; He was to see something. He was to
tell what he saw. There's a delightful touch of
the simplicity of natural speech here. He turned
to <i>see</i> the <i>voice</i>. And he saw Him who was the
voice of God to him. Then the sight is told in
the same simplicity of speech.</p>

<p>There is a group of candlesticks, light-holders,
made of gold. And in the midst of the group
there is some One standing. He is in outer
form like a <i>man</i>. But there is such an overpowering
sense of divine glory that John falls on his
face as one dead. Yet through all this overwhelming
experience the impression of a man
stands unmistakably out.</p>

<p>With keen, quick glance John takes in head and
hair, eyes and feet, voice and hands, mouth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Page 80]</a></span>
face. A simple, natural man in every outer particular
like himself, a brother man, wearing
man's garb and girdle. This is the first impression
indelibly stamped on John's mind.</p>

<p>But there's more, ah, much more than a man
in this man! This is the stupendous part. There
is some One, other than man, and more than
man, possessing this man. The divine fills the
human. It is this sense of the glory filling the
man that is so overpowering to John.</p>

<p>A glorious presence overshadows the man and
shines out of Him, but never obliterates nor
makes the man less. That indescribable glory
within shining out through the man magnifies
every part of His human being. The head and
hair are white, not like a pale or painted white,
but a transparent whiteness, an intense searching,
glowing light shining out from Him through
the human head and hair.</p>

<p>The eyes are as a flame of pure fire, the feet
like melting metal glowing in fire. And the
whole countenance was as the sun in its noontime
strength shining out of a rainless, cloudless
sky. Humanity enveloped in deity, yet remaining
true, full humanity. God within man immeasurably
more than man, yet not overwhelming,
not disturbing nor obliterating, any part of
his humanity, rather making every part stand
out more distinctly.</p>

<p>Is this incidentally a kind of parable? Is it
something like this on an immensely humbler
scale that was meant for us men? God the Holy
Spirit dwelling in a man. He the chief one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Page 81]</a></span>
the divine one, yet expressing Himself <i>through</i>
the man, and doing it fully to meet the need of
the hour. His presence magnifying, vitalizing,
and using every human power, yet Himself the
dominant personality.</p>

<p>It is most striking to note that this is the
same in principle as every appearance of God in
the Old Testament pages. Sometimes He talked
with men when there is no suggestion made of
any appearance or of what the appearance was
like. But wherever the appearance is spoken
of it is always either fire or some touch of the
human kind or both.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[59] Genesis xv.</p></div><p>In Eden He waits and speaks, two human
things. He talks with Abraham as a man talks,
and ratified the covenant by passing fire through
the pieces of the covenant sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><span class="snlabel">[59]</span> It is as
a simple, natural man appearing at Abraham's
tent door that He talks about Sodom. It is a
human voice speaking about Isaac, though no
appearance is mentioned. Moses sees a flaming
bush, and hears a voice in the desert, and sees
a whole mount aflame while a voice speaks at
Sinai.</p>

<p>And so it was always: the fiery presence-cloud
in the Wilderness, Joshua's Captain taking command,
Manoah's angel ascending in the flame of
the altar, the voice in the night heard by Samuel,
the flooding of Tabernacle and Temple with
the glory-presence, Carmel's fire descending,
Elijah's &quot;still small voice,&quot; Isaiah's vision of
glory and the voice, Ezekiel's man of flame speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Page 82]</a></span>ing,
and Daniel's, both of the latter two akin to
this Revelation appearance.</p>

<p>But there is a distinctness and a fulness of
description here greater than at any previous
time, yet the same essential thing as at every
appearance of God in Old Testament pages. The
coming of Jesus among us has brought God
closer to us and made Him mean more. Jesus
was God coming closer and in a way that we
could understand better and take hold of more
easily.</p>

<h4>The Identifying Mark.</h4>

<p>But let us reverently look a little closer that
we may understand yet better. There are certain
characteristics of this Man of Fire that are
allowed to stand sharply out here. We are
meant to look at them. This is part of the
purpose in the heart of Christ in letting us see
Him as He is here.</p>

<p>The sense of <i>purity</i> is intenser than can be put
into words. Fire is pure. There is nothing so
pure. It resists impurity. It burns it up. It
is most significant that this is the one thing familiar
to us that always accompanies the presence
of God as He appears to men. It is always in
fire whether to speak His message of peace and
love or to remove the impurity of evil.</p>

<p>Our God is a consuming fire. Yet fire only
consumes what can't stand its flame. The fire
reveals purity and makes pure. God is pure.
The presence within the man looked out in eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Page 83]</a></span>
of flame, in a countenance like the sun, and feet
like molten brass glowing in a furnace. There
could be no stronger statement of purity than
this.</p>

<p>Then there is an overwhelming sense of
<i>authority</i>. That seems the human word to use,
though the word seems to tell so much less than
John felt. John feels it more than he can tell
it. He cannot tell it in words. His limp figure
lying flat on the earth tells what words never
can. He had seen the glory outshining in the
Transfiguration Mount, but this is unspeakably
beyond that.</p>

<p>There was a voice like a trumpet. It commanded
John to write. It says: &quot;I <i>became</i> dead,
and, behold! I <i>am</i> alive forever more.&quot; It is an
authority over life to yield it up, and over death
to put it to death, and call life back, never again
to be touched by the finger of death. No such
authority is known among men to-day. And this
is further emphasized in the quiet words: &quot;I
have the <i>keys</i>&mdash;- the control&mdash;of death and of the
whole spirit world.&quot;</p>

<p>But immensely more than all this to John was
the intense feeling of majesty which completely
overpowered him. The sense of authority was
overwhelming. The items in the description can
thus be catalogued, but it is impossible to get
the overwhelming sense of majestic authority that
came to John, except as he got it,&mdash;by a <i>sight</i>,
something of a sight of this great crowned
Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[60] Ezekiel i. 26-28.</p><p>[61] Daniel x. 5-9.</p></div><p>But <i>who</i> is this? Is this not merely Ezekiel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</a></span>
vision repeated?<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><span class="snlabel">[60]</span> He saw just such a vision,
one in the likeness of a man, enveloped in fire,
and sitting on a throne. And the effect was the
same as Ezekiel lies flat on his face. Is it not
the same as Daniel saw?<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><span class="snlabel">[61]</span> A <i>man</i> clothed in
linen, aflame with inner fire, and the same authoritative
voice, and Daniel in a deep sleep of
awe-stricken stupor with face on the ground?
He does indeed seem to be the same. The descriptions
tally remarkably.</p>

<p>But listen. He speaks. And the sense of terrifying
authority in the voice that spake is gentled
to John's tense ear in the quiet words that come.
Like the loving words that came to Daniel's
quaking heart is the personal message that came
to John,&mdash;&quot;Fear not.&quot; And with the words, as
ever, come the new sense of stilling peace within.
&quot;I am the First and the Last, and the Living
One.&quot;</p>

<p>Still it may be Ezekiel's Man even yet, or
Daniel's. But listen: &quot;and I <i>became dead</i>.&quot;
Ah! this identifies Him. Now we know for the
first time that this Man of Flame is Jesus our
Brother-man. The cross becomes the mark of
identification. The form of the words as spoken
fits in with the sense of authority. With great
strength of heart in carrying out a great purpose
He &quot;<i>became</i> dead.&quot;</p>

<p>This is Ezekiel's Man and Daniel's and <i>more</i>,
unspeakably more. The Man they saw has lived
amongst us for a generation of time, and then
given His life clear out for us. He has be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Page 85]</a></span>come
more in coming as Jesus. He has taken
human experience and suffering up into Himself.
He was Creator. He has become more&mdash;Saviour.</p>

<p>There is the same purity and authority speaking
out here as there. But here is <i>love</i> speaking
out as never was spoken out before. Here is
love <i>lived</i> out; aye, here love is <i>died</i> out, and
never living so much as when dying. Here is
love putting death to death for us. Purity and
authority fastened on a cross! This is love
such as man had never known, and God never
shown before. Calvary lets us see the love that
burned in the purity and controlled in the
authority.</p>

<p>John's Man is Ezekiel's and Daniel's, but with
the love shining out through purity and authority,
and outshining both. Yet that love is the
purity and authority combined in action. We
don't know love only as we know God. And
we don't know God only as we know Jesus not
living merely but pouring out His life for men.
This is love&mdash;that Man, that God-man, but with
the God-glory hidden within, using all His
authority over His life to fasten His purity on a
cross with the thorns of our sin, and then throttling
death and bringing up a new sort of deathless
life for us. This&mdash;He&mdash;is love.</p>

<h4>The Outstanding Characteristic.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[62] Daniel x. 20.</p></div><p>But we haven't gotten to the heart of this
yet. There is immensely more here than even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</a></span>
this. The distinctive thing, the characteristic
thing in this sight of Christ, is yet to be noticed.
All of this can be gotten from other sights of
Christ. But notice now keenly <i>where this Man
of Fire is</i>. For this is the distinctive thing. He
is not up in the heavens, as in Ezekiel. He has
not come on a special errand, as in Daniel's experience.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><span class="snlabel">[62]</span>
He is walking <i>down on the earth</i>.
His whole concern is about affairs on the earth.</p>

<p>But note where He is on earth: not in Jerusalem,
the Jew centre; not in Rome, the world's
ruling centre, nor in Athens or Corinth, the
world's culture centres. He is seen walking
among a small group of candlesticks. This is
the centre of earth action for Him. This is <i>the
significant thing</i> of this new sight of Christ. Let
us look at it a moment to get at the simple significance
of the scene.</p>

<p>The candlesticks, we are told, are the Churches,
the little groups of followers banded together
here and there. These small groups of Christ's
followers are called <i>candlesticks</i> or lampstands.</p>

<p>There is no suggestion yet of their giving any
light. No lighted candles nor oily wicks are
burning and shining. They are only candle<i>sticks</i>.
They are of gold, the most precious metal, but
they can give no light, they can only hold the
light some one else supplies. The Man standing
amongst them is the light. The whole effect of
the sight of Christ here is that He is the
light. The presence within the man shines out
through head and eyes and limbs, as light, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Page 87]</a></span>tense
dazzling light, even as the sun in his
strength.</p>

<p>Here is the distinctive thing. Christ's whole
interest centres in the earth. All heaven is
bending over watching the run of events down
here. The intensity of His suffering and death
tell the intensity of Christ's interest in the movement
of things on the earth. He has a plan. He
has put His very life into it. It centres wholly
in the affairs of us men down here. And it centres
in His Church.</p>

<p>This quite upsets our common ideas about the
centre of things down here. We class London
and New York as the great financial centres;
Paris and Berlin as the great fashion and military
centres. Rome is the centre of authority
of the Catholic Church, and St. Petersburg of the
Greek Orthodox. The Man who holds all power
in His hands, and on whose word everything
depends, quietly brushes all this aside with scarce
a move of His hand. The earth-centre of things
is the Church. That is, the groups of his followers
banded together in various parts of the
world.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is seen as a magnificent organization
intimately connected with the machinery
of government. Sometimes as very small groups
of persons with no social standing, despised and
reckoned as not worth reckoning with. But this
is the thing He is depending on for getting out
to His world. All His plans centre here.</p>

<p>He is the light. The light He gave and gives
through nature, and within every man's breast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</a></span>
has been awfully darkened through refusal and
neglect to use it, through stubborn self-will. It
is so darkened that ofttimes it seems to have
been quite put out. His coming amongst us as
one of ourselves, living our life, dying on our
behalf to free us from sin, rising again victorious
over death, sending His Holy Spirit to
make all this real and living to each of us,&mdash;this
is the light at its full shining, the flood-light.</p>

<p>He has made a plan for sending this flood-light
to every one in every part of the earth.
That plan centres in His followers. He is the
light. The Church is the light-bearer, the candlestick.
It is to hold <i>Him</i> up in such a way that
men everywhere can get in direct touch with
Him. When He is held up, the darkness goes.
The darkness can't stand the light. This is the
immensely significant thing here. This is the
sight of Christ needed to-day, a sight of Him as
He stands <i>waiting</i> on the Church to carry out
His plan for the earth.</p>

<p>The faithfulness of the Church is not measured
by compact organization, costly houses of
worship, impressive services, eloquent scholarly
preaching, and a ceaseless round of organized
activities. It can be told only by how much of
the spirit of the Christ who died is carried, in the
daily life of its individual members, into home
and social and commercial circles until men are
compelled to feel its power in conviction of the
sin of their own lives.</p>

<p>Nor yet is it told by transplanting the western
type of civilization to far-away lands, with schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Page 89]</a></span>
and hospitals and innumerable humanizing influences.
All this may be blessed. And it will
be blessed and blest. But it is the incidental
thing. It is sure to follow where the Jesus light
is allowed to shine clearly through and out. It
is quite possible to have these good things without
getting the real Christ. It is quite impossible
to have Christ Himself without such influences
coming, too.</p>

<p>The emphasis must be not on these things, but
on Him, Christ. Men need Him. He answers
the heart longing, and only He can. He changes
the nature, and nothing else is enough. The
Church is to take the loving, healing, personal
Christ to men in the fulness of His power, and
to all men. This is the measure of its faithfulness.</p>

<h4>What Christ Sees.</h4>

<p>The tremendous question that crowds in here
is this, What does this Man of Fire see as He
stands among His followers? And He tells us.
This is why the vision is given. He wants us
to see things as they look to His eyes of flame.</p>

<p>The Man and His message are one thing here.
Chapters one, two, and three belong together,
and should be held together in our minds. We
have put the Man and His message as separate
talks to get a clearer grasp of each. But they
are <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>Now we recall enough of the message to note
this. Five-sevenths of the light-holders are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</a></span>
bad shape. The lamps are smoky, badly smoked,
and cobwebbed. The light is dimmed. It can't
get out through the lamp. The crowds are standing
in the darkness and falling into the ditch by
the side of the road.</p>

<p>Two-sevenths let the light clearly out. The
others are an intermingling of light and light
obscured, but with the obscurity overcoming the
other. The net result is an irritating smokiness.
And the movement unhindered would naturally
be toward a steady increase of smoky irritation
and obscurity until no light can get through.
This is what He lets us see that He sees.</p>

<p>Now the instinctive thing to do with a smoky
lamp irritating nostrils and eyes is to put it out.
That is the first instinct. The second is to trim
the wick and do whatever else it needs to correct
the smokiness. <i>Yet He waits.</i> That first natural
instinct is restrained. The candlesticks are not
yet moved out of their place. The light still tries
to get out through them. The human candlestick
may yet do the needful trimming and cleaning.
With marvellous restraint He <i>waits</i>.</p>

<p>It is a tremendous scene that is stretched out
here before us,&mdash;purity and authority combined
in One who is standing in the midst of impurity
and failure. The purity is more intense
than we can grasp. The authority is greater
than any one can realize. The impurity, the
failure, are bad clear beyond what we can take
in. The whole natural instinct here would be a
<i>cleansing</i>, instant and radical, a correcting of the
evil. Yet He waits. The purity would act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Page 91]</a></span>
through the authority; the authority restrains the
purity. Love quietly, strongly holds both in
check. This restraint, this inaction is tremendous.</p>

<p>Why this inaction? this restraint? And the
answer is simple, and as sweeping as simple.
His plan at this stage shall have fullest opportunity.
His followers will be given full opportunity
to the last notch of time and the latest
possibility of their being yet true.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[63] Hebrews x. 13.</p></div><p>All the intensity of His love, all the eagerness
of His expectancy,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><span class="snlabel">[63]</span> all the fulness of His plan
for the earth, yes all the millions of the race, all
the misery and ignorance, the sin and darkness,
the millions of babies being born into wretchedness,
and the millions of non-Christian women
being held in slavery, and the countless numbers
in every land groping along in a darkness that
not only can be felt, but that is felt to the hurting
point and then past that to the insensitive
stupor,&mdash;all this waits.</p>

<p>With a heart that feels all that any man is feeling
and that breaks under it, He waits that fullest
opportunity shall be given His followers to be
true. If His Church is set aside it will be only
at the last moment when her failure is utterly
hopeless. If the candlestick is removed out of
its place, it will be only after it has completely
removed itself out of all touch with the Light.
A candlestick holding out no light is an utterly
useless thing to the man in the dark.</p>

<p>It is possible for the Church to be a magnifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Page 92]</a></span>cent
organization, an honoured institution, exerting
immense influence in national politics, enormously
rich in gold and in scholarship and in
traditions, and even in carrying forward an aggressive
missionary propaganda, and yet be faithless
to its one mission. If the Church should fail
in this its one mission, then the waiting time is
over. The way is clear for the next step in the
world plan. And a momentous step that would
be, beyond our power to grasp. But the waiting
time still holds out.</p>

<p>This is the simple, tremendous plea of this
new sight of the crowned Christ as He is shown
here. The centre of the universe to Him is
this earth. The centre of things on the earth
is His Church. The centre of things in the
Church is its giving Jesus the Light out to all
the earth.</p>

<p>And if this be the way things looked to His
eye at the close of the first century, how, think
you, do they look at this beginning of the twentieth?
Has that momentum of movement toward
increasing smokiness slacked? Is the waiting
time nearly run out?</p>

<p>The present is a momentous time. Even
men of the world speak of the world-wide restlessness
as pointing to some impending event
of world size. And he who is in some sort of
simple touch with the spirit world can feel the
air a-thrill with the possibility of world events
impending, even while he wonders just what and
when.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Page 93]</a></span></p>

<p>One in the Midst.</p>

<p>It is most striking how it came about that
John got this sight of Christ. The change was
not in Christ's presence, but in John's eyes.
Christ did not come. He was there. John's eyes
were opened. Then he saw Him who stands
watching and waiting. <i>Christ is here.</i> The Man
of Fire and of restraining love is here on the
earth in the midst of His Church looking and
longing, listening, and feeling.</p>

<p>If only our eyes were opened to see! There
standeth One in our midst whom we recognize
not. Wherever any company of believers banded
together as a Church to worship and pray and
break holy bread are gathered, under whatever
local name or in connection with whatever
Church communion, <i>He stands in the midst</i>, this
crowned Christ of the Patmos Revelation.</p>

<p>Our eyes need treatment. The hinge of the
eyelid is in the will and in the heart. A bended
or bending will opens the eye. A brooding heart
opens it yet more in spirit vision. Then we shall
see Him, <i>as He is now</i> in our midst, waiting our
obedience.</p>

<p>Those forty days between the resurrection and
the ascension are seen to be illustrations of this.
One can see through this Revelation sight that
this is one of the chief things the Master is
teaching as He still lingers on earth in His resurrection
body.</p>

<p>Along the old Emmaus road, gathered about
the evening meal in the twilight, twice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</a></span>
upper room at Jerusalem, He appears to little
groups of His faithful followers. Their hearts
are burning with the thought of Him, they are
talking with both tongue and eyes about Him.
But that He is in their midst is the last thing to
come into their minds. Then their eyes are
opened to see Him in their midst. It was a forty-days'
session in their training school. Then He
said quietly as His bodily presence goes up into
the blue: &quot;Lo! <i>I am with you all the days until
the end.</i>&quot; Their mission and His presence are
inseparably linked.</p>

<p>And it is striking again to note how John's
Gospel ends. The others describe the Ascension.
John begins his Gospel with Jesus in the bosom
of the Father before the world was, and ends
with Him walking and talking with a little group
of fishermen along the shore of the waters of
Galilee's Lake.</p>

<p>This is what the Church needs to-day, a sight
of Christ <i>as He is now</i>. Nothing else can save
its life. And nothing less can save its mission
from utter impending failure.</p>

<p>And yet while the distinctive message here is
for the Church, it is an individual message, too.
It is for each of us. I am the Church, as much
of it as I am, counted as one. You are the
Church. The Church is made up of you and me
and the rest of us. I must take this message for
as much of the Church as I am. The Man of
Fire is depending on me to be a candlestick
for His light. It is on me He is patiently waiting
to obey as fully as He means I should.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Page 95]</a></span></p>

<p>And on you.</p>

<p>A recent incident is told of a man whose name
is a familiar one in the financial world, who died
a few years ago. He was the executive head of
one of our country's great railways. And a
man of remarkable largeness of insight and grasp,
and of unusual power of execution. He dealt
in hundreds of millions as easily as most of us
deal in dollars, and his rugged honesty has never
been brought into question. His greatest achievement
bulks big in the material structure of one
of our great eastern cities.</p>

<p>But his gigantic tasks ran his strength to ebb
tide, and then it was seen that the tide was running
out. As he lay in the sick chamber a minister
called, whose ministry had touched large
numbers of the men in the railroad of which the
sick man was head, and in the course of conversation
tactfully asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you a Christian, Mr. Blank?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the quiet, prompt reply that rather
surprised the minister.</p>

<p>&quot;How long have you been a Christian, Mr.
Blank?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two days,&quot; came the answer as promptly
and quietly.</p>

<p>Feeling that there was an interesting story
under these answers, the minister gently pressed
the question. Then the story came out.</p>

<p>&quot;You know William, who handles freight out
here at &mdash;&mdash;?&quot; the sick man asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He showed me the way.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;William&quot; had been a worthless, drunken
man of the &quot;down and out&quot; sort. He had been
converted at some mission and been radically
changed. He had gotten employment at one of
the freight-handling stations of this railroad system.
It was rough, hard work, but he had gone
at it earnestly in his purpose to live an honest
life. And in his quiet, earnest way he was always
seeking a chance to speak to men of Christ
as a personal Saviour, until he became known
throughout that part of the system for his simple,
earnest piety.</p>

<p>As the sick man realized the seriousness of
things for him he had sent for this William.
The president of the road whose capitalization
ran into hundreds of millions sent for the rough-handed
freight handler. And William in his
simple, earnest way had pointed the sick man
to Christ. And the man of millions had made
a new sort of transaction. Christ and he had
an understanding.</p>

<p>And as the sick man told the minister the story
he paused, and then added, &quot;<i>I have given my
strength to the secondary things.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>This was the judgment of this shrewd man of big
affairs as the new light had come into his life at
its close. Happily he had gotten the readjustment
of values in time for readjustment of personal
relationships. But his life's strength was gone.</p>

<p>If we might get the readjustment that would
put secondary things in second place, and put
wrong and useless things clear out, <i>in time to be
of some use to our blessed Lord</i>.

<h4>Patmos Spells Patience.</h4>

<p>Patience is strength at its strongest, using all
its strength in holding back from doing something.
Patience is love at flood pleading with
strength to hold steady in holding back.</p>

<p>The love in the strength insists on waiting a
bit longer for the sake of the one being waited
for. The strength in the love obeys the love
passion and takes fresh hold in holding back.</p>

<p>Patmos spells out the patience of our Lord
Jesus. It tells the strength and tenderness of
His love. Olivet spelled out His <i>plan</i>, His great
sweeping plan, <i>through His followers</i>, for a race.
Calvary spelled out His <i>passion</i>, passion of love,
passion of suffering, in dying for a race.</p>

<p>Calvary, Olivet, and Patmos are inseparably
linked, the gentle slope of the Jerusalem hillside,
the little mount to its east, and the little rocky
isle in the far &AElig;gean. Calvary was the passion
of love pouring out a life for a race. Olivet
was the plan of love for telling a race, till every
one would know the love by the feel. Patmos is
the patience of love pleading with the should-be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Page 100]</a></span>
tellers of the story to carry out the plan, and
waiting, and then waiting just a little longer.</p>

<p>Olivet had heard the last word. There the
Master had told the disciples the plan. All the
race was to be told and taught, bit by bit, earnestly,
repeatedly, patiently, tirelessly, by word
and act and life. He Himself unseen by outer
eyes would always be with them, His supernatural
power making real and living what they told
and taught. This was the plan. Olivet was to
be the executive of Calvary, bringing home to
men and making vital to them what had been
done there.</p>

<p>Then Jesus went up on the Cloud. And they
went out everywhere. And His power convincingly
went with them just as He had said. Within
a generation the news and the power had gone
together to the outermost rim of the world they
knew.</p>

<p>They were expecting Him to return as a result
of this witnessing of theirs. The next time they
see His face and hear His voice will be as He
comes on the Cloud out of the blue. So they
understand and believe. This is their constant
expectancy.</p>

<p>Now that generation has moved off the scene
of action. Another generation has come in its
place, and has almost run its course and moved
off the scene. And still they are looking forward
to and talking about His return.</p>

<p>But now to this new generation of His followers
something quite different comes. Instead
of Himself coming in glory there comes another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Page 101]</a></span>
last message to them. It fits perfectly into the
Olivet message, but goes further and says something
more.</p>

<p>The Olivet message is about taking the light
of the Gospel message out everywhere. The
Patmos message in its pictured setting of candlesticks
and Man of Fire and blazing light recognized
this as the one thing to be done, but says
there's something the matter with the candlesticks.</p>

<p>The Olivet word is about taking the message.
This Patmos word is about the messengers. That
one is about the <i>service</i> of His followers; this
other about their <i>life</i>. The life underlies the
service. Nothing can so hinder and hurt the
service as a life not true in itself. Here something
in the life of the Church is hindering its
service. The Master's plan at this stage is in
danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[65] Acts xv. 14-18.</p></div><p>His broader plan extends beyond this Church
movement. This is one great step to be followed
by another. That broader plan had been outlined
at the first Church Conference, held in
Jerusalem. James, the presiding officer, said
that the carrying of the Gospel to all men was
to be followed by a national regeneration of the
Jews; and then through a regenerated Jewish nation
there would be a new era of world-wide
evangelization,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><span class="snlabel">[65]</span> and with this the Conference was
in agreement.</p>

<p>The leaders among these early disciples are
eagerly anticipating Jesus' return to carry on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Page 102]</a></span>
next stage. They understand that what they
are doing is preparing the way for this next
step.</p>

<p>But now instead of returning to carry forward
the broader plan here comes another
message. Apparently things are not going satisfactorily.
The plan at this stage is in danger,
while the Calvary passion back of it still burns.
Failure is impending. The Master <i>might</i> sweep
aside the men that are failing, and press on Himself
into the next step of His plan. For the case
is urgent. A race is waiting. The darkness
thickens.</p>

<p>But instead He waits. With patience and
strength and love beyond our power to grasp He
waits. This is the setting of the Patmos message,
to which we now turn.</p>

<h4>The Unity of the Message.</h4>

<p>We must keep our eyes on the Man who is
talking. His overawing presence gives tremendous
meaning to His words. That gentle touch
of the right hand has no doubt strengthened John
even as Daniel was strengthened. And he is
standing and looking as he listens. But the sight
of that wondrous Man walking among the candlesticks
floods his face and his whole being
indescribably as he listens to the message
spoken.</p>

<p>The overpowering sense of awe, of reality
and power, and of the tremendous meaning of
what is being said never leaves. So he listens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Page 103]</a></span>
So we must listen. So only can we get into the
meaning of these words. The words will mean
only as much as the Man means in the intensity
of His presence. You must keep your eye on
this crowned Christ as you listen.</p>

<p>The seven-fold description given us of Christ
is the key to these seven messages. The partial
description beginning each message is seen to
fit into the particular condition of the Church
spoken to. Yet all these bits of description must
be put together to get the full description. It is
a seven-fold description of one person.</p>

<p>And so all the messages must be taken together
to see the Church as He sees it, and to get His
message to it. It is one message. A look at the
seven promises made to the overcomers makes
it clear that all seven are one promise. It is not
that one overcomer receives one thing, and another
another, but each one gets all of what is
mentioned in the seven. A rather careful, swift
look at these promises makes this clear enough.</p>

<p>It is spoken to one Church in seven groups
in seven different cities. There is one call to
repentance, one warning of what will happen to
the unpenitent at five successive stages, one plea
to hear seven times repeated, and one blessed
result to the overcomer, in a seven-fold statement.</p>

<p>And there is just one evil to be recognized and
fought. That evil is seen to grow from one degree
to another, from bad to worse and worst.
Its emphasis changes from one phase to another.
It has shown itself differently in dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</a></span>ferent
parts of the world, and in different ages
since, but it is the one evil power, always the
same behind the different manifestations.</p>

<p>There is rare combination and adaptation in
this message. It was meant for the Church of
that day, and of every day since, and for some
future day. For it stands as the one message
from Christ to His Church between Olivet and
His return. It is meant distinctively for the
Church as a whole, and yet it makes an intense
personal appeal to each one in the Church.</p>

<p>It is spoken to the little groups of Churches
in Asia Minor grouping about the city of Ephesus,
which had been founded by Paul and ministered
to by John. And without doubt it fitted
into the conditions and tendencies of those particular
seven Churches.</p>

<p>But these are representative of all. Probably
any group of seven would be representative of all
in varying degree. The mother Church at Jerusalem
is not named, nor the great Gentile missionary
Church at Antioch. But these messages
with their approval and criticism, their warning
and promise, were meant for all the Church in
Asia and Europe and Africa at that time.</p>

<p>They are found to fit into the need of the
Church scattered throughout the world in every
generation since then. Always there have been
little groups that were faithful and true, always
some suffering because of their faithfulness and
remaining faithful in spite of suffering. And
always those who have been formal, who have
companioned with evil, who have been swamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Page 105]</a></span>
by the evil with which they companioned, and
those practically asleep or dead.</p>

<p>This Patmos message will be found to fit the
Church of to-day with remarkable accuracy and
faithfulness. And the whole probability is in
favor of finding that it will fit peculiarly the
future Church, the Church at the end of this
present period.</p>

<p>This whole book of the Revelation is peculiarly
a Church book. While it is full of instruction
and plea for our individual lives, yet it is
distinctively <i>the</i> Church book. It stands out
among the books of the New Testament as the
one book addressed to the Church and to the
whole Church.</p>

<p>It gives the great bulk of its space to an awful
time of persecution that is coming to the Church
at some future time. This is spoken of elsewhere,
notably by Jesus in His talk with the disciples
on Mount Olivet, but it is the chief subject
treated here. And it is treated with great
detail. The name commonly applied to this coming
persecution is the great tribulation.</p>

<p>It is significant that the book that clearly is
distinctively a Church book is taken up chiefly
with a description of that future persecution. It
leads to the deep conviction that this book of the
Revelation so fitted to the need of the Church
when spoken, and in every generation since,
will be found to be peculiarly fitted to that generation
of the Church that is to pass through
this great coming persecution; that is, to the
Tribulation Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Page 106]</a></span></p>

<p>It will probably be the mainstay and comfort
of those who will insist on being true during
those awful days, regardless of the suffering
involved. No book has been more slighted and
ignored. It has been called by some within the
Church of our own generation &quot;the joke of the
Bible.&quot; It will likely come to be the book
most studied and loved for its light and help in
the terribly troublous times ahead. There will
be an eager, hungry searching for every scrap
of information, and for any fresh ray of light
on its meaning.</p>

<h4>The Seven-fold Message.</h4>

<p>Now this seven-fold message lets us see things
through Christ's eyes. He is letting them and us
see what He sees. The Scottish poet's thoughtful
lines might well be changed to get the yet better
look: &quot;Oh! wad some power the giftie gie us,
to see oursel's as&quot; <i>God</i> sees us. It would do
more than free us from blunders and notions.
And we are needing more.</p>

<p>Each one of these seven messages begins by
our Lord drawing their eyes to Himself. This
is the thing needed most. And this will give
meaning and force to the message. They are
to be looking at Him as they listen. Then He
speaks of all the good things He sees. Then of
the faulty, weak, bad things, in a few simple but
unmistakably plain words. No one could doubt
what He meant.</p>

<p>Then is the pleading call to repent, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</a></span>
faithful warning of what will surely happen if
they don't. Then the earnest plea that His words
be listened to and taken to heart, and the wondrously
gracious promise held out to those who
steadily set themselves against the evil, and who
get the victory.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at each of these
Churches as seen by those searching eyes of
flame.</p>

<p><i>Ephesus</i> is the centre of the group, the natural
leader, the largest and most influential, perhaps
the mother Church of the group, where
Paul and John had put in so much time and
strength, and whence they reached out to these
others.</p>

<p>Christ reminds them of His presence in their
midst and His control of the angel messengers
that minister to them. Then he speaks of their
good deeds, their tireless activity, steadfast endurance,
intense zeal for the true faith, with
special emphasis upon their unwearying steadfastness
even under sore difficulties, and their
hatred of those who made compromise with evil
so hateful to Himself.</p>

<p>But there is something lacking, the tender personal
love for Himself. There's intense loyalty
to Church and to the faith, but a lack of personal
love for Himself. And the startling thing is
that this is said to quite outweight all these
good things. They may have these things without
the love, but they cannot have the love without
having these things, and at a finer temperature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</a></span></p>

<p>And this defect is crucial. If persisted in it
is fatal. It will actually mean their <i>rejection
as His messenger</i>. This is the critical thing
which we seem to have such a hard time getting
hold of. The essential qualification for true service
is the personal attachment to our Lord Jesus
Himself, that warm heart love which the human
heart longs for and gives to some one. He longs
for this. This is <i>the</i> essential; not Church organization
nor creed, not zeal for orthodoxy, but
warm love for a person. Service, witnessing,
all the rest, are valuable to Him in reaching His
world only as they grow out of a tender love for
Himself.</p>

<p>And the startling thing is that this privilege
and opportunity of service is to be taken away
<i>not</i> because displeasing to Him, but because it
fails of the end in view. The candlestick is only
removed because it is no longer serviceable;
it is not giving out the light. This earnest, aggressive,
orthodox, patiently-enduring Church is
to be rejected as a light-holder, because it is not
holding out the light. This is tremendous!</p>

<p>The group in <i>Smyrna</i> is tenderly reminded of
the suffering of their Lord, for they are filling
up what is left behind of His suffering. This
tells at once the depth of their personal love for
Him, nothing could tell it more.</p>

<p>They are poor in money and so despised, but
rich in faith and so precious to Him. They are
suffering at the hands of the Jews, who were the
outspoken, intense, fanatical enemy of the Christians.
There is no reproach, only earnest en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Page 109]</a></span>couragement
to keep steady even through fiercer
fires yet to come.</p>

<p>The description of Himself to the <i>Pergamum</i>
group is startling. He is the one with a sharp
two-edged sword. There is something here He
must fight against. They are frankly told that
they have had a hard place to witness in, and earnestly
commended for being true even in the
midst of persecution.</p>

<p>But there's something wrong, and it is very
serious. It is as wrong and bad as it can be.
There is actually compromise with evil, partnership
with the world in its wickedness. The
thing is put in the intensest way possible by
characterizing it as adultery. No stronger language
could be used to tell how He sees the
evil they are guilty of. And they are plainly
told that He will fight against them. They have
made themselves His enemy by joining His
enemies.</p>

<p>The <i>Thyatira</i> group is reminded of the purity
of their Lord, who cannot stand impurity but
searches it relentlessly out, and pursues it to
the death. There's a faithful minority here.
Their activity and love and faith and patience
and increasing activity in service are all counted
carefully over and warmly commended.</p>

<p>But the evil here is much worse. It is put
into the gravest language. &quot;Thou sufferest the
woman <i>Jezebel</i>.&quot; This is most significant.
There is no worse character named in the whole
Old Testament. She not only represented the
worst adulterous uncleanness in herself, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Page 110]</a></span>
was the national leader energetically fostering
unclean idolatrous practices among the people.
Jezebel pulled God's light-holder nation down to
the lowest moral level it ever reached. She
brazenly dominated king and people, and remained
stubbornly obstinate to the terrible
end.</p>

<p>Christ brings <i>her</i> name in here. Again this
is tremendous. No more terrific parallel could
have been made. Here evil characterized as
adulterous has actually come to a place of leadership
in the Church. With great longsuffering
time has been given that all this might be
changed, but with Jezebel-like obstinacy it was
determined that there would be no change. And
the inevitable result that will surely follow continued
obstinacy will be a great tribulation or
deadly persecution.</p>

<p>The <i>Sardis</i> group is told that Christ is the
centre of all life and help, in the control of the
Holy Spirit and of the angel messengers. There
is nothing to commend here. There are some
who insist on living true lives, but they are a
scanty scattered few, not enough to count.</p>

<p>There are some ragged remnants of good, but
even these are sickly and nearly dead. The
Church is well organized, energetic, standing
high among men, but with an utter absence of
spiritual life. The personal lives of most are
like dirty garments. And the warning is this:
He will come as a thief, that is unexpectedly,
disagreeably, to take away what they prize most
and leave them stripped and naked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Page 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The longest message is to the group in <i>Philadelphia</i>.
Christ reminds them that He is holy
in character, faithful to His promises, having
full control, and giving opportunity of service
as the highest reward of faithfulness. This candlestick
is giving out light, for it is given yet
further opportunity of shining.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of this group is its
steady plodding faithfulness. They are not
spoken of as brilliant or talented, but faithful
in the midst of opposition. He loves them with
the sort of deep love drawn out by love freely
given. And a special promise is given, a significant
promise. A great persecution is coming,
an awful testing time to all the earth. But He
will keep them <i>through</i> this unhurt because they
have been keeping His word so faithfully.</p>

<p>The common reading here is, &quot;I will keep thee
<i>from</i> the hour of trial.&quot; It is quite as accurate
to read &quot;through&quot; in place of &quot;from.&quot; And
there is good reason for taking this as the
sense here. The word underneath here is
translated by several different words in other
passages.</p>

<p>Where a word in one language may be translated
by any one of several words the general
sense of the passage must decide which one correctly
expresses the meaning. Here the meaning
must be gotten from the whole trend of New
Testament teaching. Like the Israelites during
the plagues that came to Egypt these faithful ones
will be kept untouched through this terrible time
that is to come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Page 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Laodicea</i> group is to be talked to plainly
by one who is a true, faithful witness in dealing
with His people's faults, and who has all the
authority of God in doing so. This is the second
group that actually has not one good thing to be
commended. There is no false teaching, no
compromise with evil; they are simply <i>asleep</i>.
Rich, influential, self-satisfied, grown fat and
sleek,&mdash;so they seem to their neighbours and
themselves. Wretched, poor, blind, naked,&mdash;so
they are. And the chastening threatened will be
of the severe radical sort that strong love insists
upon.</p>

<h4>A Heart-breaking Sight.</h4>

<p>Here then is the picture of the whole Church
as seen by the eyes of searching flame. There is
a mixture of bad and good, active bad, active
good, and sleepy indifference. There is a Church
within the Church. But the bad is bad enough
and big enough to endanger seriously the usefulness
of the whole as a light-bearer.</p>

<p>The glass of the lantern is so smoked and
cobwebby that it is more useless than useful
to the light inside, and the crowd outside in the
dark. The uselessness threatens what usefulness
is left. Smokiness is contagious. Cobwebs
grow thicker and hold more dust.</p>

<p>Two Churches are true and pure in the midst
of sore opposition. Two are corrupt in the very
worst way. Three, including the leader, are orthodox
in form, but indifferent to Jesus Himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Page 113]</a></span>
or asleep, or dead; three degrees of the same
thing,&mdash;indifference, sleep, death.</p>

<p>In all of these five there are those who, like
Ezekiel's companions, &quot;sigh and cry over the
abominations that are going on,&quot; but they are
helpless to stay the sweep of the tide. They
are the salt that is saving the lump so far. Even
Sodom would have been saved by ten righteous.</p>

<p>It is plainly said to the leader Church that it
is no longer of use as a candlestick, except a
change come. It fails to give out the light. It
is being carried along, patiently borne with <i>for
its own sake</i>. It is failing at this point in the
mission. The smoking flax sending out its
irritating smoke in place of clear light is not
yet quenched. The Holy Spirit life within is
being sorely grieved, but is not yet put entirely
out.</p>

<p>And this is only one. Four others are plainly
in much worse fix. Five-sevenths are failing.
That bit of preservative salt would seem to be
working to its full capacity.</p>

<p>This is the picture given us here by our Lord
Himself. John would never have dared make
such a terrific arraignment of his own accord.
It is a picture of the whole Church at the beginning
of the First century.</p>

<p>How is it at the beginning of the Twentieth?
A thousand million people, two-thirds of the
race, pretty freely supplied with the light of
western oil and of gunpowder, with the help of
the western sewing machine, and with the guidance
of western learning and skill, but to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Page 114]</a></span>
with minor exceptions no scant ray of this light
has yet gotten, these make answer. That smokiness
would seem to be rather dense.</p>

<p>The non-Christian crowds in so-called Christian
lands, the overwhelming majority, to whom
the name of Jesus has no more practical meaning
than other foreign names, Shanghai, or Tokyo,
or Calcutta,&mdash;these make answer. The light
doesn't seem to have been able to get through
and out much, even near the candlestick.</p>

<p>The Church itself, when it has sometimes forgotten
its statistical tables long enough to look
thoughtfully into this old Patmos looking-glass,
has now and then made answer, in a few of its
thoughtful leaders, while the rank and file push
on absorbed in their Ephesian or Sardisian or
Thyatiran way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[66] Ezekiel viii and ix.</p></div><p>There's a striking companion bit to this in
Ezekiel's vision.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><span class="snlabel">[66]</span> That messenger to the exiled
colony by the Chebar had first of all the vision
of God that completely overwhelmed him. Then
he is taken in spirit to Jerusalem, and shown
things as they were, through God's eyes. The
heathen idols were set up in the very temple of
God, so actually stimulating among the people the
horribly gross, unnamable impurities connected
with their worship. This was done in the open,
with no pretence at concealment.</p>

<p>Then in the vision he digs &quot;into the wall&quot;
to see the hidden things that are being done.
There he sees every sort of creeping, crawling,
slimy, repulsive animal pictured on the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</a></span>
this secret chamber, and the leaders of the people
burning incense and worshipping.</p>

<p>This he is told is a picture of the <i>inner hearts</i>
of the men who are the leaders of the nation.
For dramatic intensity it would be hard to equal
this. The imaginations of their hearts are as
the unclean snakes and beasts that are found
only in the damp, unwholesome slime and ooze
of swamp and stagnant pond.</p>

<p>And this is God's light-bearing nation to all
the earth. And these are the leaders! But
there's yet worse. The mothers and wives and
daughters of the nation, the real moulders of
the nation's life and character, are seen pouring
out their very hearts over a heathen idol, with
all the horrible evil practices included in its worship.
And then a group of men are shown
in the holy temple standing with their backs
to God and His temple and worshipping the
sun.</p>

<p>Under these four items are pointed out the
impurity and violence, the injustice and oppression,
that mark the people. It is the inner heart
life of the nation that is being pictured so vividly.
But in the midst of all this are those who
are broken-hearted over these conditions. And
as the time of judgment comes in the vision these
are marked and spared, though they see the work
of judgment on every hand.</p>

<p>Such is the tremendous scene depicted by
Ezekiel. It will be seen at once what a striking
parallel it presents to the scene in this Revelation
book with the new light-bearer to the na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</a></span>tions
of the earth. One would never dare make
such an arraignment of his own accord. It is
humbling and heart-breaking to the last degree
simply to repeat what is spoken here by our Lord
Himself.</p>

<p>Clearly the Patmos picture is not only of
the Church then, but ever since, and now. And
the simple law of momentum in sliding down hill
will make it an accurate picture of the Church
at the end, the future Church.</p>

<p>The colouring changes at different times in different
places, the black getting intenser, pot
black, and the light shining out more brightly
by contrast. But the picture remains essentially
as painted on Patmos.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[67] Rev. ii. 5.</p></div><p>The warnings so faithfully given run a sliding
scale outward and downward in five degrees.
If the Church continue as it is, it is told here
that it will be rejected as a light-holder. Its
privilege and opportunity as God's messenger will
be taken away.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><span class="snlabel">[67]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[68] Rev. ii. 12-16.</p><p>[69] Rev. ii. 22, 23.</p><p>[70] Rev. iii. 3.</p><p>[71] Rev. iii. 16.</p></div><p>Then Christ will fight against it as an enemy,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><span class="snlabel">[68]</span>

of the mouth, as personally disgusting.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><span class="snlabel">[71]</span></p>

<p>Yet in all this plain speech there is no bitterness,
only grief, only tender pleading. The plain
bluntness is the language of love that yearns
to save even yet, and that waits with untold patience
hoping for a change.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Page 117]</a></span></p>

<h4>Wooing Promises.</h4>

<p>But it is noticeable that, while the warning is
to the corporate Church, the plea and promise
that persists throughout is to the individual. He
that is <i>willing</i> to, let him hear and heed and be
controlled by the Spirit's message.</p>

<p>There are two groups that have remained
faithful. There are scattered through the other
five those who are faithful. And there are no
doubt many who feel the pull to be true but are
yielding to the strong undertow of the rising
tide by which they are being carried.</p>

<p>The coupled promise and plea that call out
so pleadingly to these at the close of each message
are, &quot;to him that overcometh.&quot; This word
&quot;overcometh&quot; is very significant. It is one of
the characteristic notes of these messages and
indeed of this entire book. It is one of that
sort of word that sums up a whole situation in
itself.</p>

<p>There is opposition. There is conflict because
some won't yield to the opposition. And the
result of the conflict varies. Some are overcome
by the evil; they go over to the enemy, body and
soul. Some wabble. They slip along the line
of least resistance, secretly holding on to some
few ragged remnants of convictions, but not letting
these affect their standing or comfort or
particularly their profits.</p>

<p>Some overcome evil. There is struggle tense
and continued, quickened breath, moist brow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</a></span>
tightened nerves, the stain of blood, a scar here
and there, and heart-breaking experiences. But
they fight on, and victory comes. And the evil
is less, weakened in its hold on this companion
and that neighbour. They get the victory over
evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[72] Rev. ii. 7.</p><p>[73] Rev. ii. 11.</p></div><p>There's a wondrous promise to these. It is as
though the treasure box is placed at their disposal.
It is a seven-fold promise. Every overcomer
will receive all that is contained in
these seven promises. Note this seven-fold
promise: He that overcometh will have everlasting
life,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><span class="snlabel">[72]</span> and this is emphasized by the
reverse statement, &quot;will not be hurt of the second
death.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><span class="snlabel">[73]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[74] Rev. ii. 17.</p></div><p>He will be admitted into the sweets of intimate
fellowship with his Lord, hidden from all
save those in this inner circle. And will receive
a new name, the family name, that is an
inheritance in the family of God, joint heir with
Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><span class="snlabel">[74]</span> He will have the privilege of
serving with the King in the blessed Kingdom
time coming.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[75] Rev. ii. 26-28.</p><p>[76] Rev. xxii. 16.</p></div><p>And with this goes the word, &quot;I will give
him <i>the morning star</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><span class="snlabel">[75]</span> Jesus calls Himself
&quot;the bright, the morning star.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><span class="snlabel">[76]</span> The morning
star rises in the dark of night after midnight and
ushers in the new day. He who is in touch of
heart with Jesus as the night deepens to the
dawn will (probably) have an intimation in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</a></span>
inner spirit of the glad coming of the Morning
Star that ushers in earth's new day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[77] Rev. iii. 5.</p><p>[78] Rev. iii. 12.</p><p>[79] Rev. iii. 21.</p></div><p>The overcomer will be made perfect in character,
and find his name not only in the family
book, but mentioned by Christ personally to
His Father before the angels.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><span class="snlabel">[77]</span> He will be admitted
into the innermost circle of the King
and be reckoned among the dependables.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><span class="snlabel">[78]</span>
And he will have closest fellowship with
Christ in the administration of the wondrous
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><span class="snlabel">[79]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that these promises overlap,
the same thing being put now positively, now
negatively, and being repeated in differing words
to different groups. Each promise touches the
characteristic trait of the group spoken of. The
Ephesians, who had many things but lacked
the vital thing, are wooed with the promise of
life itself, which is only through touch with
Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>Smyrna in its suffering is cheered with the
prospect of suffering no more. The Pergamum
overcomer is wooed away from intimacy of
friendship with evil to intimacy of friendship
with the coming King. They who resist the evil
Jezebel rule in Thyatira will have the privilege
of ruling with the King. Those in Sardis who
hunger and thirst after a pure heart will have
the longing fully satisfied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[80] Rev. iii. 20, 21, with Jeremiah xiv. 8.</p></div><p>Those who have proven dependable in the
trying days in Philadelphia will have the exquisite
pleasure of being depended upon in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Page 120]</a></span>
inner circle as wholly trustworthy. Those in
Laodicea who resist the current and insist on letting
the knocking pilgrim in for heart fellowship<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><span class="snlabel">[80]</span>
will find themselves in fellowship with
Him on the throne.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that these promises are
one promise, and that that is the promise of everlasting
life, of a purified perfected character,
and of the privilege of closest fellowship with
the King Himself in the coming Kingdom time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[81] Rev. v. 10.</p></div><p>These promises do not take up the matter
of rewards for faithfulness in service, such as
our Lord speaks of in the twin parables of the
pounds and talents. The things promised here
are the results of being saved by the blood of
Christ. The privilege of fellowship with the
King during the Kingdom time is included in
salvation. All the redeemed will reign over the
earth.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><span class="snlabel">[81]</span></p>

<p>This is significant. Overcoming would seem
to be the decisive evidence of faith in Jesus
Christ, the faith that receives everlasting life.
It takes opposition to let you know whether you
are willing to accept Christ. A man does not
know whether he really believes Christ until
he is opposed in his believing, and opposed to
the real hurting point. He has just as much
faith in Christ as he is willing to declare, and
stand by, and insist upon, <i>when he is under fire</i>.
Opposition is the fire test. Faith isn't faith
unless it can stand the fire test.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Page 121]</a></span></p>

<h4>The Decisive Trait of Faith.</h4>

<p>The plain inference here is that he who doesn't
overcome shows that he really doesn't believe in
his heart. And the natural result is that he does
not receive these things promised. That is, he
is not saved because he won't accept the Lord
Jesus as his Saviour <i>when it comes to the fire
test</i>.</p>

<p>There are without doubt thousands in the
Church who will be left behind on the earth when
our Lord Jesus catches up His own. This does
not mean necessarily that they will be lost.
There will be another opportunity of being saved
for those living on the earth at that time. The
Kingdom will be a wonderful time of salvation.
There will be a continuous revival of the realest
sort going on everywhere all the time.</p>

<p>But these would not have the blessed privilege
of fellowship with the King in the Kingdom,
nor the blessedness of fuller resurrection
life <i>at this time</i>. That is reserved for those who
by grace have believed on the Lord Jesus, during
His absence and continued rejection, in spite of
the fire of opposition.</p>

<p>It is notable that the Thyatiran message speaks
of <i>great tribulation</i> coming to that Church if it
continue unchanged. And that the Philadelphia
Church is to be kept through &quot;the hour of trial,
that which is to come upon the whole earth.&quot;
Throughout the Scriptures mention is made of a
time of persecution coming at the end. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Page 122]</a></span>
common term for it is tribulation. It is called
<i>the great tribulation</i>. There will be more to be
said about this again.</p>

<p>It is possible that it will be found that this
Patmos message will have special significance
during that trying time at the end. But it should
be noted that it fits into the <i>spirit of opposition</i>
that is <i>always</i> found where there is true,
faithful witnessing.</p>

<p>The tribulation itself will be the time of intensest
opposition carried to the extreme of violent
persecution. It will be the climax of conditions
always present, wherever there is faithful
witnessing. Faithfulness to Christ always
arouses opposition.</p>

<p>The test of whether we really accept Christ
and believe Him is not in anything we say. It
is not even in what we are in our lives when
all goes smoothly. It is in what we are in our
lives <i>when opposed</i>, when it costs criticism, ostracism,
petty persecution, or more outright persecution.
This is our Lord's test of acceptance
of Himself.</p>

<p>We have had many definitions of what it means
to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. And these
have been helpful in clearing the air and helping
us to a simple acceptance of Him. These
definitions have touched chiefly the <i>inner</i> part of
faith, the part we are conscious of.</p>

<p>Here is another definition. Here is the last
word on the subject, the authoritative word,
from our Lord Jesus Himself. It tells what
faith is in its outward working, the part the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Page 123]</a></span>
<i>crowd</i> sees. The faith that accepts Jesus as
Saviour accepts Him also as Lord.</p>

<p>That faith naturally rings true to Him under
all circumstances. It rings truest and clearest
whenever opposition to Him is aroused, whether
the opposition of indifference, of criticism and
sneer, or of persecution.</p>

<p>There are certain commonly accepted things
that are in themselves only good, but which are
not <i>conclusive</i> evidence that we really have saving
faith in the Saviour. The act of coming
into Church membership whether by confirmation,
by an assent to questions regarding one's
personal faith, or by being baptized, the fact
of membership in the Church, the partaking of
the Lord's supper, serving as an official of the
Church in pulpit or pew, faithful attendance, liberal
support,&mdash;these things are only good.</p>

<p>But they do not furnish conclusive evidence
of one's acceptance of Christ. It is quite possible
to be carried along on the common current
in such things. There is clear evidence that
many are. The decisive thing, the test thing is
this: <i>how we stand opposition</i>, the polite, sneering
sort, the more aggressive sort, or&mdash;if it come
to that&mdash;the violent sort. The <i>fire</i> reveals every
man's faith if there be any there.</p>

<p>There are two fire tests. One is of our faith
in Christ, as revealed in the frictional fires of
opposition. Whoever stands that test is caught
up into His presence when He comes, or goes
at once into His presence if our going precede
His coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Page 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is of the love-spirit, how far it
has been the very breath of our life as revealed
by the fire of His presence. For the love-spirit
means personal loyalty to Jesus, purity of heart,
holiness of life, steadiness of purpose, and the
exquisite gentleness of patience in our conduct
toward all others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[82] Psalm cxxxix.</p></div><p>These words of our Lord Jesus are very
searching. This Patmos message must have been
a painful one for Him to give John, and painful
for John to repeat. It is painful for any one
to repeat when its meaning is understood. It
should send one off into some quiet corner alone
on his knees with that great &quot;search me&quot; prayer
of the Psalmist.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><span class="snlabel">[82]</span></p>

<p>Recently I was told a simple incident of one
of the truly great Christian men of our generation.
He was at the head of one of the largest
concerns of our country employing thousands
of men, but never knowing any labor troubles. I
remember the impression made on me a few
years ago at the time of his death, by the remark
made to me by two different men of this
man's city, men that I think did not know each
other, or maybe very slightly. As I spoke of
him each man said in a subdued voice, &quot;Oh,
everybody in &mdash;&mdash; loved Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p>This incident was told by his son. The two
were on a train together. The father rose and
went forward to another part of the train. As
he went out a man sitting opposite came over
and spoke to the son. His flashy manner of dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</a></span>
and the fact that he seemed to have been drinking
suggested the sort of man he was. He said
to the son:</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't that Mr. So-and-so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the son replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; the man said, as though talking half
to himself, &quot;if there were more men like him,
there'd be fewer like me.&quot;</p>

<p>And he turned to his seat and sat as though
absorbed in his thought. The son, in speaking of
it after his father's death, said it was one of the
tenderest memories he had of his father.</p>

<p>The common crowd on the street and our
Lord Jesus are united in one thing: they want
<i>more men like Him</i>, Jesus our Saviour. Then
there'd be fewer of the other sort.</p>

<h4>A Look into Heaven.</h4>

<p>Heaven is a place of intensest and tenderest
interest to every one. It is true that there is
less emphasis on getting to heaven as a result
of being saved than there was a generation ago.
Indeed, no emphasis at all. The whole thought
now is about our life here on the earth. We
think less about dying and more about living.</p>

<p>This is true. Yet every one of us has loved
ones who have slipped from our grasp, and gone
from our midst. We think of them. The tenderest
memories brood over us, and come like
a flood sometimes.</p>

<p>We may have the sweet sense of assurance
that these loved ones are saved. But there is
an intense longing at times to know more about
them, where they are, what they are doing, how
much they know of things down here. These
thoughts <i>will</i> come crowding in upon us.</p>

<p>Now here is some light. <i>All</i> the questions are
not answered. But there comes clear, sweet
light to comfort our hearts during the waiting
time until we shall be joined with them again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Page 130]</a></span>
We are given here in John's Revelation the first
clear, definite glimpse into the upper world. It
is told us in the language of earth of course.
It must be, else we would not understand. But
clearly there is a glory and happiness clear beyond
what earthly words can tell.</p>

<p>This is the first glimpse into heaven given
us in this old Book of God. Jacob wakes up
in his dream and sees a ladder set up connecting
earth and heaven, and the angels going up and
returning again while God talks with him. It
means much to him, but gives us no answer to
our questions, except to make plain that there
is a very real and wondrous world up there where
our loved ones go.</p>

<p>Moses is up in the mount with God for six
weeks nearly, twice over, but there is no suggestion
of what he may have seen; only the
transfiguring change in his face, and the strongly
gentling change in his character.</p>

<p>Ezekiel finds the heavens opening and sees
the vision, so like John's, of the wondrous Man.
Stephen looks up steadfastly into heaven and sees
the resplendent glory of God, and the crucified
Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Paul
is caught up into heaven, not improbably at the
time that his body lay bruised and bleeding and
apparently lifeless outside Lystra. But the
sights he sees and the over-awing glory are too
much to be told. But here John is taken up in
vision into the heavens, into the presence of God,
and sees much, and tells us what he sees.</p>

<p>It was after the vision of the glorified Man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Page 131]</a></span>
His message. John is sitting thinking on all he
has seen and heard, thinking back to Ephesus
and the other Churches he knew so well. He is
wondering perhaps <i>how</i> he <i>can</i> tell them what,
whom, he has seen; and wondering too how he
can tell them this message entrusted to him.</p>

<p>The holy spell is still strong upon him, when
all at once he noticed what looks like a door, a
door opened above him in the blue. And as he is
looking, astonished, that same voice that had
been speaking with him before speaks again. He
is bidden to &quot;come up hither,&quot; and he will be
shown the things that are to happen some time
in the future. At once he is conscious of that
same gentle, enveloping presence of the Holy
Spirit as before. At once He is up in heaven.
And he tells us the scene that opens to his
eyes.</p>

<p>There is a throne set. What a comfort! There
is a <i>throne</i>. There is a centre of authority and
power to our world. This Revelation is peculiarly
the book of a <i>throne</i>. Up yonder above
the moral tangle and confusion of earth is a
reigning throne.</p>

<p>There is One sitting on the throne. That
throne is occupied. It has not been vacated.
Men down here may push God off the throne
of their lives, and try to push Him out of the
affairs of the earth. But He sits on the throne
above. And that throne dominates the life of the
earth. Nothing can be done without permission.</p>

<p>John can't describe this one sitting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Page 132]</a></span>
throne. The sight is too much for his eyes.
When the seventy elders of Israel see God, all
that they can remember is the dazzle of glory
in the wonderful pavement under His feet. It
seems like a pavement of precious stones of
sapphire, but as clear as crystal. So now all
that John can see is some One who seems to his
eyes like transparent precious stones blazing with
light. This is the only thing he can think of
to tell of what he sees.</p>

<h4>Rest in the Midst of Unrest.</h4>

<p>There is a rainbow around the throne. The
radiance of light shining out from this One on
the throne makes a rainbow. If one wonders
how God can look down on the misery and sin,
the rebellion and wretchedness that dominate
most of the earth, here is the answer. His finger
is never off the pulse. He knows all as we never
can. And he feels as we never do the pain of
life, and the discord of earth. The unceasing cry
of earth comes up in his ears.</p>

<p>But He is controlled by a purpose. It is a
purpose of strong patient love. <i>He has made
a promise</i> that man shall have fullest opportunity
unchecked by the natural sweeping judgment,
that invariable working out of sin and wrong.
That throne keeps the order of nature working
smoothly and faithfully for man's sake, holding
in restraint the forces that would hinder and
destroy. The rainbow is the signature to His
promise. That rainbow is always before His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</a></span>
face. That promise has never been forgotten.
This explains the quietness of the One on the
throne, looking down on the moral confusion of
the race.</p>

<p>But this rainbow is not like the common rainbows
that we know. It completely encircles the
throne. Our rainbows are broken up. They are
never seen in their completeness. Our lookout on
things sees only a part; it never sees all. It is
never complete. The view of things up there is
complete. Everything is seen and is seen in its
true relation to everything else. The throne is
the one place of perfect perspective and poise.</p>

<p>And this rainbow is all of one colour, a clear,
soft emerald-green. We know that green is the
most restful of all colours. Some colours are
irritating. Some persons of very sensitive, nervous
temperament are even made sick by certain
colours. And we are all affected more than we
know in a hurtful way by certain colours. But
green is the colour of rest. It soothes the eyes
and nerves and even the spirit. The rainbow
round about the throne looked like a quiet, quieting
emerald-green. The One on the throne is at
perfect rest regarding things down here. He
knows all. His ears hear all, the cry of distress
and despair, the defiance and arrogance and blasphemy.
His eyes see His children down here,
creative children all of them, prodigal children
so many of them, and trusting children walking
in the shadows. He sees all. And He feels all
with His great feeling heart.</p>

<p>Yet He is at rest. Do you wonder how He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</a></span>
can be? When Jesus saw the multitudes He was
moved with compassion; He suffered in heart
with them, for they were as shepherdless sheep,
torn and distressed. And the heart beating in
rhythm with His has as hard a time as He. If
He lead you in service to some foreign mission
land, you see and know and feel as no tourist
party hurried through the outer fringes ever does
or can.</p>

<p>And in Christian lands of the West, and the
homeland, in slum as in polite circles, in commercial
quarters as in the university world, the
heart that is in touch with Jesus' heart sees and
hears and feels and senses things as they are under
the surface or sticking boldly out through
the surface. And feels at times as though it can
never again be at rest.</p>

<p>How can He, on the throne, be so quiet, and
be at rest? And there is an answer to our burning
question, a simple, real answer. <i>He knows
the end.</i> He has a purpose and a plan. The
present is only one stage in His great plan. This
is man's opportunity, and possibly some one's
else opportunity, too. It is to be followed by
something else radically different down on this
earth.</p>

<p>He is held steady during this time by a great
purpose. It is a purpose of great, tender love.
To His eye looking sleeplessly down there is rest
even as of emerald-green. And so there will be
rest for him who looks sleeplessly <i>up</i> to the
<i>throne</i> of control, encircled in the emerald rainbow
of perfect peace. And we can be of best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</a></span>
service to Him by resting in our hearts, resting
in Him, even while working in the thick of things
as they are down here.</p>

<h4>They See His Face.</h4>

<p>Then John sees twenty-four other thrones
round about the central throne. And on these
there are twenty-four men sitting. These men
are wearing white garments, and have crowns of
gold upon their heads. This is the part of intense
interest. Who are these? And what does
this mean?</p>

<p>What has been said before about picture language,
the language of the Orient, of childhood,
of the common crowd, the universal language,
will help us here. The Bible is an Oriental book.
It talks in picture language. This is humanly
what gives it such freshness and peculiar adaptation.
The radical change of circumstances and
speech and mode of thought in different centuries
makes all books antiquated after a certain
time. This book has the freshness of youth, for
in its simple picture language it deals in principles.
But picture language must be held to
its simplicity. And something of familiarity
with the whole range of the Scripture is needful
to use the key to the simple picture language.</p>

<p>Let us look a bit at the simple scene here.
These men are elders, that is they are leaders.
They represent multitudes of others. Throughout
the Bible twelve is the number of completeness,
both in things and people. A complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</a></span>
gathering or throng of people is represented by
the number twelve. There are twelve tribes of
Israel, and so on. This is so familiar that
it need only be named without further illustration.</p>

<p>There are two great divisions of this Bible,
the Old Testament and the New. These stand
naturally for the two great divisions of time, before
Christ and after. This division is strongly
marked in the Bible, and sharply marked in our
Christian consciousness. It has been a common
thing to wonder about the salvation and spiritual
knowledge and privileges of people who lived before
Christ came and died.</p>

<p>Twice twelve make twenty-four. These
twenty-four elders represent the redeemed ones
from both of these great divisions of time. That
is to say, the picture tells us this. All the people
from creation's earliest morn up to the present,
including the one who went out last from some
sorrowing family circle, all who have had the
touch of heart with God, are gathered in the
presence of Him who sits on the throne. That is
one simple thing that stands out clear and sure.</p>

<p>These are represented as <i>sitting</i>. The slave
or servant never sat in his master's presence.
Friends sit together. Angels are never spoken
of as sitting in the presence of God. When our
Lord Jesus was received up He sat down at the
Father's right hand. We are spoken of as seated
in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Sitting
together means being on terms of intimacy and
fellowship. Through the precious blood of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</a></span>
Lord Jesus we are all accepted in the Beloved and
received and trusted as He is.</p>

into the presence of the Father, as the full recognition
of His worthiness and of what He had
done, and in vindication after the shameful rejection
by men.</p>

<p>These men and women and children in the
Father's presence have been rewarded and are
being rewarded for their faithfulness in obedience
and in life. All the struggles and difficulties,
the hard road, the endurance, the patient
suffering for His name's sake, the faithfulness
in doing the allotted tasks, all these have been
noted and acknowledged. There is the sweet
peace of the Father's approval in all of these
before the throne.</p>

<h4>Going to School to God.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[92] Matthew xix. 28.</p><p>[93] Luke xxii. 30.</p><p>[94] Rev. iii. 21.</p></div><p>And these are sitting on <i>thrones</i>. When Jesus
was teaching His disciples, in the dark days of
bitter opposition He wooed them with this: &quot;Ye
shall sit upon twelve thrones.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><span class="snlabel">[92]</span> And a bit later
as they sat round the supper table on the night
of His betrayal, when things are getting to the
darkest, again He woos them: &quot;Ye may eat
and drink at my table in my Kingdom; and ye
shall sit on thrones.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><span class="snlabel">[93]</span> He that overcometh is
assured of sitting with Christ on His throne.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><span class="snlabel">[94]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[95] Rev. v. 10; xx. 4, 6.</p><p>[96] Hebrews i. 14 with Daniel vii. 10 and Psalm ciii.
20-21.</p></div><p>All the redeemed ones of earth are to have
part with Christ in the coming Kingdom time.
They reign with Him.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><span class="snlabel">[95]</span> During this present time
the countless hosts of angels have a part in min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Page 139]</a></span>istering
to man on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><span class="snlabel">[96]</span> Even so during
the Kingdom time to come the countless hosts
of the redeemed will have the sweet privilege of
service with Christ and on behalf of those on the
earth. And it is quite possible that they already
have a part in such a ministry.</p>

<p>A little farther in the description it is seen
that these elders have &quot;each one a harp, and
golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers
of the saints.&quot; Heaven is a place of wonderful
music. Its very atmosphere must be tuned
to the rarest rhythmic harmonies. And each one
has part in the music being made.</p>

<p>And yet more, they are continuing the sweet
ministry of intercession learned down on earth.
This means that they are in touch with earth.
They know the needs of loved ones and of all,
and they have the privilege of fellowship in
this with Him who ever liveth to make intercession.</p>

<p>And there is one other thing we know here
at once without being told. If a friend tells me
that he has a rose garden under the care of a
skilled gardener, I know without being told that
the roses are growing. I at once look through
my friend's words and see bushes full of roses
of all colours, some full blown, some half blown,
some bursting buds, and some just budding. For
there is a garden, and a gardener, and sun and
rain and dew. I know there must be growth
and beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Even so we know that the loved ones who have
parted from us, are growing. They are in the
Father's presence, in intimate fellowship. That
tells me of their growth. That little one who
slipped away so young, years ago, has been growing
in mental powers, in character as well as in
what down here we call stature, and growing
most of all in love. And so at the meeting time,
in the air or up there, there will be instant recognition,
as well as instant delight over the growth
under such wondrous tutorage.</p>

<p>This is the glimpse into the upper world which
John sees and is allowed to give us here. The
redeemed ones of earth of all the ages are in
the presence of the Father and of the Lord
Jesus and of the angels, on terms of intimate
fellowship, made pure and perfect in character,
but always growing from more to more, and
having a share in blessed ministry. And they
listen to and have share in making music more
exquisite than our earthly language can describe.</p>

<p>They understand the wondrous plans for the
earth, for now they see all things through the
Lord Jesus' eyes. They have some part without
doubt in welcoming those who come to join
them, even as they will have part in receiving
those who are caught up at our Lord's return.
And they look forward eagerly to the glad time
of righting that will come then.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[97] Rev. viii. 5; xi. 19; xvi. 18, 21.</p></div><p>But let us look a bit more at what John sees.
Out of the throne are seen proceeding lightnings
and voices and thunders. Three other times in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</a></span>
this book it speaks of lightning and voices and
thunder.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><span class="snlabel">[97]</span> These things of course are the familiar
accompaniments of a storm. It is noticeable
that each other time they are named in the
book it is in connection with some direct action
being taken by God in the affairs of the earth.
And each time there is some added item intensifying
the scene.</p>

<p>A physical storm is caused by two areas of unequal
temperature coming together. The storm
is the process of coming together and equalizing
of the atmospheric conditions. The inference
here would seem to be that the time of action
has come to straighten out matters on the earth.
The two moral atmospheres of heaven and earth
seem to be coming into contact, and a storm
is resulting before clear weather comes. It suggests
that our Lord Jesus is taking the next
direct step in His broader plan.</p>

<h4>God's Ideal of Creation.</h4>

<p>But let us look a little further. In the book's
picture language there are &quot;seven lamps of fire
burning before the throne.&quot; These we are plainly
told &quot;are the seven spirits of God.&quot; That is a
Hebrew way of saying &quot;the perfect spirit of
God.&quot; This is of intense interest. The Holy
Spirit is represented as being before the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[98] John xiv.-xvi.</p></div><p>In the confidential talk with the inner group of
disciples on the betrayal night, in John's Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><span class="snlabel">[98]</span>
Jesus promises that when He has ascended up
to the Father He will send down the Holy Spirit
to them. When the Spirit has come down to
the disciples He will begin a new ministry of
witnessing to the world through them.</p>

<p>In the Book of Acts that promise is fulfilled.
The Spirit comes down with remarkable manifestations
on the day of Pentecost. The distinctive
thing He does is to take possession of a
group of men and form them into a new witnessing
body called the Church. He had dwelt
in the nation of Israel as a nation, and had been
withdrawn from that nation when it proved finally
faithless to its mission. He had dwelt in individual
men before and during and after that
time.</p>

<p>At Pentecost He is sent down on a new mission.
He is to do in men all that Jesus has
done for them in His life and death and resurrection.
But the distinctive thing of Pentecost
is His forming this new body called the Church,
through which He begins a new ministry of witnessing
to the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[99] II Thessalonians ii. 6-7.</p></div><p>All through the Acts and Epistles He is constantly
spoken of as here on the earth working
in the Church and through it. He in the Church
is a powerful restraint upon the powers of evil
in the world. In Thessalonians,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><span class="snlabel">[99]</span> Paul has
spoken of a day coming when that restraint
would be withdrawn. The Holy Spirit, the
&quot;One that restraineth now,&quot; is to be taken away.</p>

<p>Now here the Holy Spirit is represented as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</a></span>
being, not in the Church, as always in the Acts
and Epistles, but as being &quot;before the throne.&quot;
This is the second significant thing to note in
this scene. This also would seem to suggest the
beginning of a new order of things.</p>

<p>John goes quietly on with his description. Before
the throne he sees a great expanse that looks
like a sea of clear, bright, beautiful crystal. Before
the throne and around about the throne are
four living creatures or creatures of life. These
living creatures are of intensest interest. They
appear throughout the Scriptures from the Garden
of Eden in Genesis to the very close of this
Book of Revelation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[100] Ezekiel i. 4-28; x. 1-22.</p><p>[101] Exodus xxv. 17-22; xxxvii. 6-9.</p><p>[102] I Kings vi. 23-26; viii. 6-7; II Chronicles iii. 10-14;
v. 7-8.</p><p>[103] Ezekiel xli. 15-26.</p><p>[104] I Samuel iv. 4; II Samuel vi. 2; xxii. 11;
I Chronicles xiii. 6; Psalm xviii. 10; lxxx. 1; xcix. 1;
Isaiah vi. 1-3; xxxvii. 16.</p><p>[105] Genesis iii. 24.</p></div><p>They are also called cherubim and seraphim,
that is, cherubs and seraphs. They are always
associated directly with the immediate presence
of God,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><span class="snlabel">[100]</span> and with His presence-chamber, in the
tabernacle,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><span class="snlabel">[101]</span> in the temple,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><span class="snlabel">[102]</span> and in Ezekiel's
vision of a new temple,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><span class="snlabel">[103]</span> and in the thought of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><span class="snlabel">[104]</span> There is one possible exception to
this, where they are seen at the entrance to the
Garden of Eden.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><span class="snlabel">[105]</span> The description of them is
most full in Ezekiel. It varies in details, but
with the essentials always the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The general appearance is that of a man, but
there are four faces as of a man, a lion, an ox
or calf, a flying eagle, and sometimes a cherub
face. They are full of eyes everywhere, and they
seem enveloped in the pure fire which everywhere
is associated with God's own presence. These
descriptions combined suggest perfection of
purity, of intelligence, of obedience, and of
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[106] iv. 6-9; v. 6, 8, 14; vi. 1, 3, 5, 7; vii. 11; xiv. 3;
xv. 7; xix. 4.</p></div><p>In this book of the Revelation they are spoken
of seven times,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><span class="snlabel">[106]</span> that is, more frequently than
in any other book, though not so fully as in
Ezekiel. Five times they are leading or joining
in the worship of God, by men and angels, and
twice they are co&ouml;perating with the Lamb or the
angels in what is being done on the earth.</p>

<p>These beautiful, intelligent beings seem to represent
the whole animate creation, man, the animals
intimately associated in service with man,
those that roam at will, and the birds, and the
angels. It would seem as though they stand for
<i>God's ideal of creation</i>, as it was before the hurt
of sin came, as He holds it in His heart, and as
it will be after sin has gone. His ideal of a
perfect and perfected creation is always in His
presence and before His face, intelligently and
gladly carrying out His will, reverently and joyously
sounding His praise.</p>

<p>It suggests that He will not rest content until
His ideal for the creation shall be a sweet, full
realization, all sin and rebellion removed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</a></span>
all His works uniting in joyous, continuous worship,
and glad, harmonious obedience.</p>

<h4>The Significant Book.</h4>

<p>All this is interesting; some of it intense in
interest. But it is only a setting. It is incidental.
The chief thing is yet to be told. John
had been told that he would be shown the things
that would come to pass some time in the future.
We come now to the beginnings of these
&quot;things.&quot;</p>

<p>The One who is sitting on the throne has a
carefully sealed book or document in his hand.
An angel calls out loudly for any one who is
qualified to do so to step forward and take the
document and break its seals. And as John
watches intently no one comes forward. No one
can be found, either in the heaven, in earth,
or in the region spoken of as under the earth.</p>

<p>At this John is greatly distressed, and weeps
much, so he must have understood at once just
what this meant. And one of the elders comforts
him with the assurance that there is One
who has &quot;<i>overcome</i> to open the book, and the
seven seals thereof,&quot; &quot;the lion of the tribe of
Judah.&quot; This word &quot;overcome&quot; suggests that
this one has been in some great conflict and has
gotten the victory and overcome all opposition.
And this qualifies Him to take and open the
document. He is the only one among untold
numbers so qualified.</p>

<p>And now John sees this One. He is standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Page 146]</a></span>
in the very midst of the throne surrounded by
creatures and elders. We easily recognize this
as our Lord Jesus. He is a lion in leadership and
strength. He is a lamb in gentleness of character,
and in the sacrificial experience He has
been through. The marks of death are plainly
seen on His person.</p>

<p>As He comes forward He reaches and takes
the book out of the hand of the One on the
throne. He is allowed to take it. His qualification
to take the document and break its seals is
acceptable to the One on the throne.</p>

<p>And as He takes the book there is a remarkable
burst of praise and adoration that must have
made all heaven ring. And those on earth in
touch of spirit with the scene and its purpose
and the Chief Actor would surely feel some thrill
in the spirit currents of earth.</p>

<p>The outburst of worship is led by the four living
creatures and the twenty-four elders who fall
down before the Lamb and sing a song. What
music that must be when the untold thousands
sing as only redeemed ones can sing. Then
countless hosts of angels join in and lift the
chorus. And then there is the creation chorus,
every created thing in heaven and earth, under
the earth, in the sea, absolutely everything seems
to join in this indescribable music. And the four
living creatures say, &quot;Amen.&quot; And again the
elders fall down and worship.</p>

<p>John's distress at the beginning, and now this
indescribable outburst of praise, tell us that this
is something thrilling and significant beyond ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Page 147]</a></span>pression.
What does this mean, our Lord Jesus
taking the sealed document preparatory to breaking
its seals?</p>

<p>It has been said in a previous talk that every
thread woven into the fabric of the Old Testament
can be found in the fabric of this Revelation
book. So that if one goes to work patiently
he can trace every allusion here to something
back in these older leaves. This gives us the
clue to the significance of this remarkable
scene.</p>

<p>That clue seems in this case to be found in
the book of Jeremiah, chapter thirty-two. There
is found an allusion to a simple primitive custom
of the Hebrew people in the exchange of real
estate and in taking possession of property to
which one is entitled.</p>

<p>The old Hebrew custom seems to have been as
follows: When property was purchased the deed
to the new owner was made out in duplicate, an
open copy and a sealed copy. The open copy
was clearly for public information, open to all.
The sealed copy as clearly belonged only to the
owner of the property as his evidence of ownership.
So it identified him as the one named in
the open copy.</p>

<p>If a new heir comes to take possession of an
estate, or in case of a dispute over ownership,
the claimant who was adjudged the rightful heir
or owner would be given the possession of the
sealed document or deed. And as so attested
by the judge or court, he only would be properly
qualified to &quot;take&quot; the sealed roll, break its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Page 148]</a></span>
seals, read its contents, and so formally take
possession of the estate, or property.</p>

<p>Now under the symbolism of this old bit of
Hebrew custom, our Lord Jesus is represented
here as stepping forward to take possession of
the earth, and begin His reign over it. A
Hebrew immersed in the old primitive customs
of his people in Palestine would understand this
allusion at once, however startled or sceptical he
might be as to its significance in this connection.</p>

<h4>Taking Possession.</h4>

<p>The language used in the song of praise when
our Lord Jesus takes the sealed book is significant.
They say, &quot;thou art <i>worthy</i>,&quot; that is,
thou art <i>qualified</i>; thou art the duly attested one
with the right to take possession. &quot;For thou
wast <i>slain</i>, and didst purchase unto God with
thy blood men of every tribe,&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>Man had been given the dominion of the earth.
He had by obedience to the evil one transferred
his right to Him who is repeatedly called &quot;the
prince of this world.&quot; Our Lord Jesus <i>purchased</i>
men out of their slavery back to their
original Lord,&mdash;with all that was rightfully
theirs. He has allowed fullest opportunity for
all who will to accept His Lordship. Now He
is about to take possession of the earth on behalf
of men, and for them.</p>

<p>This is the tremendous significance of what
John is shown here as something that will take
place hereafter. In the scene of the candlesticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Page 149]</a></span>
He is patiently waiting, holding Himself in restraint.
Now the waiting time is over. He is
making the next move in His broader plan for
the earth.</p>

<p>There is no hint as to the length of interval
between the two scenes, how long He will wait.
There is no suggestion as to when this next move
will be made. But we are here plainly told that
at some time that candlestick waiting time will
end, and He will take a forward step in connection
with His plans for the earth. And it should
be keenly noticed that what follows now in this
book of Revelation is the run of events that will
immediately follow that next step of His.</p>

<p>Yet this step is taken up <i>in heaven</i>. The first
action of the new move will be there. There
will be nothing to be seen on the earth to indicate
the change. Things there will go on as
before, eating and drinking, buying and selling,
marrying and giving in marriage, all unconscious
of the tremendous events being worked out.</p>

<p>But now the waiting time still waits. Our
opportunity is still open. If we might only be
simple enough to be true to our absent Lord
Jesus during this waiting time.</p>

<p>A bishop of the American Episcopal Church,
widely known for his saintly character, his culture,
and long years of tireless service, was visiting
in the South. In the town there lived a
judge of wide repute for his scholarly learning
as well as for his culture and uprightness. Now
he was seriously ill, and had requested an interview
with the bishop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</a></span></p>

<p>He asked the bishop to talk to him about personal
religion. And the clergyman talked to this
thoughtful, scholarly judge in choice philosophical
language about the fatherhood of God,
the character of Christ, and the essential harmony
of man's true nature with God. The judge
listened attentively for some time.</p>

<p>Then he apologetically interrupted his visitor,
and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Bishop, I'm dying. Won't you please talk
to me just like you'd talk to my black boy,
Jim?&quot;</p>

<p>And the bishop could, and did. He told him
in simplest talk that he was a sinner. Jesus died
to save sinners. His blood washes away our
sins. We must take Christ as a Saviour, just
trust Him, as simply as a child trusts its
mother.</p>

<p>So he talked. And the judge listened. And
the tears came, and the peace. He came as a
child, and trusted, and he knew the peace that
passeth understanding. It was the simple telling
of the simple story of the Saviour who died, and
the simple, child-like acceptance of that Saviour.
The scholarly bishop helped the learned judge
best, in the crisis of his life, by talking as simply
as to a child.</p>

<p>If we might only be simple enough to be true
to this Jesus who died, during the remnant of
waiting time that remains.</p>

<h4>The Area of the Storm.</h4>

<p>Goodness arouses evil. Faithfulness to Christ
stirs opposition. This is a commonplace. A
piece of white-hot metal plunged into cold water
makes a great fuss. Two areas of sharply different
temperatures in the atmosphere above us
coming suddenly together make a storm.</p>

<p>Purity entering an atmosphere of impurity and
insisting on staying, and on keeping pure, creates
a lively disturbance. The tempter was aroused
to his subtlest effort when Jesus appeared. There
is no such demoniac activity recorded as when
Jesus walked among men.</p>

<p>So crowning a king arouses opposition, if there
be opposition. And the active taking of the reins
of government has intensified the opposition
when it was strong enough to make a stand. The
striking illustration of this in the Bible is King
David. After Saul's death the men of Judah
anointed David king. That was the signal for
an immediate attack by the chief of the forces
of Saul's house. And this was succeeded by
a long war, before David was acknowledged as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</a></span>
king over all Israel. The clearing-up storm in
his realm lasted a good while before good
weather came.</p>

<p>Here in this Revelation scene we have been
looking at our Lord Jesus is represented as stepping
forward to take possession of His realm.
It is natural to expect a storm. This will be
a signal to the opposition to rally all its power.
But there can be no question about the outcome
of such a set-to. That storm proves to be a
clearing-up storm in the realm. It is to be followed
by such fine moral weather as has not been
known before. But the storm itself proves to
be a terrific one for the earth while it lasts.</p>

<p>The greater part of this little end-book is taken
up with a description of that storm. But before
we turn to this book itself and its storm,
we want to get our bearings a bit, so as to understand
better what is here. Revelation is the
knot in the end of a big bunch of threads. We
shall understand the knot better by knowing
more about the threads before they are tied into
the knot.</p>

<p>The storm area proves to be very large. It
takes in the whole earth. The Bible is a big
book in its outlook and grasp. It deals with
the whole earth, and the whole race. The
thoughtful Bible student comes to have a broad
outlook, as well as a close lookout about his
own front and back doors.</p>

<p>It is fascinating to study the geography of the
Bible. We talk about the world growing smaller.
That refers of course to the rapidity of transit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Page 155]</a></span>
It is only within a few hundred years that we
have learned of the earth being round. The
Bible map includes practically the whole world
as we have come to know it.</p>

<p>The centre of the world as seen on this map
may seem a little surprising. We Americans
<i>feel</i> that the centre of things is here. The Englishman
<i>knows</i> that it is in London; and lately
the Germans have had the same exclusive sort
of knowledge about Berlin. The Chinese has
long called his country &quot;the Middle Kingdom,&quot;
in the sense of its being the central kingdom
about which the rest of the world revolves. But
here the centre is seen to be on the boundary
line, practically, between Orient and Occident,
reaching out an embracing arm to each.</p>

<p>We have a broad division of the earth into
East and West. The differences between the
two, in civilization, mode of thought, religion,
language, and so on, are so radical as to make
it seem that there was no point of contact. At
least this has been emphasized much by western
writers on the East. We are disturbed just now
here in the far West over the Oriental, Chinese
Japanese and Indian crossing the <i>far</i> boundary
line between Orient and Occident and coming
into the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Yet East and West have always overlapped
at the <i>middle</i> boundary line. There is a great
mixture of races in the strip where the eastern
edge of the West and the western edge of the
East come together. It is the strip running
roughly north and south where Russia's west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Page 156]</a></span>ern
border and Turkey's touch Germany and
Austria and Greece, including the never-at-rest
Balkan Peninsula. Constantinople sits on the
dividing line between East and West, with the
worst of both civilizations within her confines.
Here the hemispheres touch and their life currents
intermingle and flow together.</p>

<p>Scientific research seems to find good evidence
that all our European civilization, which
of course means American too, may have been
brought over by Eastern immigrants from central
Asia long ages ago, Asia coming into Europe.
Perhaps we Westerners would not despise
the Easterners so contemptuously and patronizingly
if we knew how much we are probably
indebted to them for our civilization as well as
for our Hebrew and Christian faith, our Bible,
and the Christian restraining bulwarks of our
common life.</p>

<p>The old common point of contact between
Orient and Occident was the strip of land forming
the western edge of the Orient at the eastern
end of the Mediterranean. Palestine has been
for centuries the common roadway of all nations,
East and West. No bit of earth has been so
tramped and trampled by the feet of all nations
and races. This has been the battlefield
of the nations through long centuries. The ends
of the earth have met here. It is interesting
that the waters that wash its western shore
are called the Mediterranean Sea, that is, the
<i>middle-of-the-earth</i> sea.</p>

<p>Here then is the centre of the map. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Page 157]</a></span>
centre of all things in the Bible. And it has
proven to be at the centre of human action
through history, attested by the very name given
to the chief body of water there.</p>

<p>Jerusalem, the capital city of this Palestine
strip, was the centre of a world power in the
early ages. It has been the world capital. And
it has in turn been fought over and conquered
by every world power. No city has been a
world centre of action during as long a stretch
of time, and to as many different nations.</p>

<p>Out from this centre the action of the Bible
reaches north to Russia, south to Africa (Ethiopia),
east to China (Sinim, Isaiah xlix. 12), and
west to Spain. That practically includes the
world of our day. America is of course merely
a transplanted seedling of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[107] Isaiah xiii.-xxiv.</p><p>[108] Jeremiah xlvi.-li.</p><p>[109] Ezekiel xxv.-xxxii., xxxviii.-xxxix.</p><p>[110] Daniel, throughout, notably vii.-xii.</p></div><p>Those great Hebrew leaders called prophets
had a world outlook. They were world messengers.
It is intensely interesting to take a
piece of paper, and pencil a rough map of the
nations named in their messages, notably Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><span class="snlabel">[107]</span>
Jeremiah,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><span class="snlabel">[108]</span> Ezekiel,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><span class="snlabel">[109]</span> and Daniel.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><span class="snlabel">[110]</span> Beginning at
Jerusalem and Israel they reach first this way,
then that, up and down, back and forth, until
the whole world of action of that day has been
touched. They were men of world size. They
had a world outlook and a world message.</p>

<p>But then God's man always has. The world
outlook of Jesus was tremendous. And every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Page 158]</a></span>
true disciple of Jesus Christ has the world outlook.
Grace broadens as well as refining. It is
one of the endless outworkings of sin that tends
toward that narrowing provincialism which
everywhere hinders so much, and so intensely.</p>

<p>Now in this world map in the Bible geography
two cities stand out beyond all others,
Jerusalem and Babylon; Jerusalem the centre
of God's people and of God's plans, Babylon
the centre of the opposing worldly power. These
are the two outstanding cities of the Bible
world.</p>

<p>Between these two there is an enmity and
warfare that is practically continuous. Jerusalem
comes to be the typical of God's people and
power and kingdom. Babylon stands out likewise
as typical of the power and kingdom always
and innately opposed to God and to His
people. The conflict between the two seems
irrepressible and irreconcilable. It is never out
of view.</p>

<p>Babylon has been the centre, under successive
dynasties, of a world empire, including not only
part of Asia, but reaching west to Europe and
south to Africa. It sat practically in the connecting
strip of Orient and Occident, ruling over
both. In the dim dawn of history a God-ignoring,
and so really a God-defying and man-exalting
movement, centred in the city called
Babel. And from that time on that city, and
its successor Babylon, have seemed as though
possessed with a spirit of antagonism to God
and His people. It is as though it were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Page 159]</a></span>
earthly headquarters of the blasphemous unseen
evil forces.</p>

<p>This is a simple bit of geography lesson in
the Old Testament. This is the map that lies
ever open in these older pages, with its two
capital cities marked large. And this indicates
the area of the storm, and the two central points
where its outburst will centre.</p>

<h4>Studying the Weather Forecast.</h4>

<p>It is interesting to find a weather forecast of
this storm. The old Hebrew prophets were
close students of national and world-wide
weather conditions, and much given to making
forecasts of impending storms. Even in the
New Testament there is this distinct prophetic
or foretelling strain running throughout. The
father of John the Baptist is told of his son's
birth; and Mary, of the unusual birth of her
divine Son. The disciples are told of the coming
of the Holy Spirit. And Agabus tells of a
great famine coming. In these instances the
fulfilment follows soon after the event is foretold.</p>

<p>The destruction of Jerusalem, foretold by
Christ, had at least a part of its fulfilment in
the terrible Titus siege of 70 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Our Lord said
that He would return to earth in great glory,
and that there would come a great tribulation
to all the earth, and repeated the old prophecy
of a restoration of the Hebrew kingdom. These
have not yet occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</a></span></p>

<p>But the book of the Revelation is distinctively
the prophetic book of the New Testament. It
deals almost entirely with events that are yet to
come. It would be natural that it would fit into
the prophetic parts of the Old Testament. So
that one who is somewhat familiar with the
prophetic books of the Old naturally comes more
intelligently to this prophetic book of the New.</p>

<p>It is true that most of us have a sense of bewilderment
about prophecy. We seem to feel
that it requires great scholarship and profound
study, and that an understanding of it is not
possible to the common run of Christians. And
so we largely leave it out as not understandable.</p>

<p>Yet prophecy is simply God's plans for the
future, together with a revelation of other events
which are not in His plan, but which He sees
will happen in the future. In it He tells us what
He means us to understand. And more than
this, our understanding will have practical bearing
on our attitude toward evil and compromise.
It will affect our faith, making it steadier, especially
when evil seems triumphant and overbearing.
It will make our prayer more intelligent
and confident.</p>

<p>There are certain things we all know. As
we read back into these pages we know that the
break-up of the Jewish nation, which began with
the Babylonian Captivity, came to a terrible climax
in a complete break-up after the rejection
of Christ. We know that the other nations
commonly called Gentiles (<i>i.e.</i>, the nations) have
had supremacy in the earth. Israel was at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</a></span>
time acknowledged as the great world power,
with many subject nations, in Solomon's time.</p>

<p>But Gentile supremacy begins back in the
time of these Old Testament pages. There is
to-day practically no belief that this will ever
be changed, except perhaps by a stray Jew here
and there, who still holds to his old Bible, and
except by those Christians who discern God's
plan, and believe both in Him and in it.</p>

<p>In the absence of an understanding of that
plan of God, it has been common to apply all
the glowing prophetic Hebrew promises to the
Church. The result has been that Israel and
the Kingdom have been confused in our minds
with the Church. And this has become the commonplace
in the common Church consciousness.</p>

<p>It is quite possible for the person of average
good sense to get something of a simple, broad
grasp of the prophetic books. It involves reading
<i>repeatedly</i> so as to get familiar with the
contents, and <i>rapidly</i> so as not to get too much
absorbed in details.</p>

<p>It is needful to use a common-sense interpretation
in getting at the meaning. It is a simple
law that one principle of interpretation should
be applied uniformly and consistently to all parts
of any one document. If I say arbitrarily, &quot;this
part is rhetorical; it doesn't mean just what it
says, but something else; and this <i>other</i> part
means just what it says,&quot; clearly I am reading
my own ideas and prejudices into the book.</p>

<p>It is much slower, and takes more pains and
patience, to keep at it until all parts gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</a></span>
clear up to us, first this bit, then that, until
part fits part, and all hang together. But there
is great fascination in it, and one's reverence
for this revelation of God's Word grows deeper.</p>

<p>Of course there is rhetorical language here as
everywhere. &quot;The Lord is my shepherd&quot; is
clearly rhetorical. For God is not a shepherd,
and I am not a sheep, but a man. But under
this simple, clearly rhetorical language the tender,
personal relationship God bears to me is
beautifully expressed. That such language <i>is</i>
rhetorical is clear to every mind alike.</p>

<p>And there is a picture language here, such
as speaking of purity of character as &quot;white
garments.&quot; The honest, earnest, unprejudiced
seeker after truth quickly recognizes these, and
learns to become skilled in discerning what is
meant. We come to see that Israel means
Israel, not the Church. Jerusalem means that
city in Judea, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course it is needful that there be an <i>openmindedness</i>,
a <i>humble, teachable spirit</i>, willing to
accept the real truth, no matter how it may shake
up one's prejudices and prearranged schemes of
thought. And, above all, there should be a constant
<i>prayerfulness</i> of spirit, to learn just what
our God is seeking to have us know. Of course
there are depths here for the scholarly, profound
minds. But we ordinary folk can get a simple,
clear grasp of God's plan and revealed insight
into the future if we go at it in this thoughtful,
prayerful way. And it will be a great help
to us to do so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Page 163]</a></span></p>

<h4>Three Great Unfulfilled Events.</h4>

<p>Let us take a swift glance at these prophetic
books of the Old Testament. It helps to remember
the natural way in which these prophetic
books grew up. These prophets were preachers
and teachers. Here are some people going up
to the temple service one day in Jerusalem. As
they get near the temple they notice a little knot
of people standing yonder at a corner listening
to a man talking earnestly. Isaiah, fresh from
the presence of God, is talking out of a burning
heart to the crowd.</p>

<p>A visitor from another part of the land says
curiously to his companion, &quot;What's that?&quot; The
other replies: &quot;Oh, it's only Isaiah talking to
the people. He is a good man, that Isaiah, a
well-meaning, earnest man, but a little too intense,
I fear.&quot; And they pass on to the temple
service. By and by Isaiah stops. The moving
congregation scatters. He slips quietly down
to his house, and under the Spirit's holy, brooding
presence writes down a part of what he has
been saying. So there grew up the rolls to
which his name is attached.</p>

<p>In some such simple, natural way these
prophetic books grew up, always under the Holy
Spirit's guidance and control. They are full of
intense fire, and of the homely talk of street
and market and fireside. There are two sorts
of these prophets, the preachers like Elijah
and Elisha and those who wrote as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</a></span>
spoke, and whose names are preserved in these
books.</p>

<p>There are seventeen of these little books.
They fall easily into four groups. The <i>first
group</i> contains those belonging in the time before
the nation was exiled. It is a period of about
one hundred and fifty years, roughly, beginning
in the prosperous reign of Uzziah and running
up to the time when the nation was taken captive
to Babylon. Isaiah is the most prominent
prophet of this period, and with him are Hosea,
Micah, and Amos, all of whom may have been
personally acquainted; and also Zephaniah and
Habakkuk.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> is <i>the exile group</i>, Jeremiah
preaching in Judah, before and during the siege,
and to the remnant left behind in the land; and
Ezekiel and Daniel bearing their witness among
the exiles in the foreign land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[111] The book of Isaiah falls naturally into two parts,
chapters i.-xl., and xli.-lxvi. The historical allusions
in each make it quite clear that these two parts belong
in two periods far apart. One hundred and eighty
years intervene between the close of the time stated in
Isaiah's first chapter as the period of his ministry and
the beginning of the return from exile into which the
second part fits.
</p>
<p>
But the full inspiration of the second part is in
no wise affected. This rarely Spirit-controlled man
modestly or unconsciously withholds his name from his
writings. And they are grouped by the old Hebrew
compilers with those of Isaiah.</p></div><p>The <i>third group</i> is made up of those who witnessed
after the people are allowed to return
to their own land again. The writer of the
second part of Isaiah probably preached to the
people as the opportunity came to return to
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><span class="snlabel">[111]</span> Haggai and Zachariah stirred up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</a></span>
the returned people to rebuild the temple. Joel
and Malachi witnessed probably a little later
in the same period.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> is the <i>foreign group</i>. Obadiah
sends a message to the neighbouring nation of
Edom; and Jonah and Nahum are sent with
messages to Nineveh. If one will try to make
a picture of these people and events by reading
the historical books, and then watch and listen
as the prophets talk, it will do much to make
these prophetic books full of the native atmosphere
in which they grew up.</p>

<p>Now there are three things that gradually
come to stand out in these prophetic books.
Much of what is being said is of immediate application.
It refers plainly to affairs being lived
out then. Then certain things are plainly fulfilled
in the coming of Christ. And again there
is a great deal that clearly has never been
fulfilled but is still future. It is the latter part
that naturally is of intensest interest.</p>

<p>Now in this latter part, dealing with the future,
<i>three things</i> stand out clear and sharp above
the rest. There is to be judgment upon Israel
for their iniquities. The changes on this are
rung again and again. And this stands out as
much in the preaching of the Captivity time,
and of the Return, as before the Captivity. But
in the midst of severest judgment there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Page 166]</a></span>
a <i>remnant spared</i>. The tree is cut down, but
the stump is spared; and there is life in the
stump. But above these there stand out these
three things.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[112] Isaiah ii. 2-4.</p></div><p><i>The first thing</i> stands out big. It is the thing
the nation never forgot. The believing Hebrew
still clings to it. The wailers at the wall of
Jerusalem to-day never forget it. It is this:
there is to be a <i>future time of great glory for
the nation of Israel in their own loved land</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><span class="snlabel">[112]</span>
The kingdom is to be restored, but with a glory
indescribably greater than ever known. This is
the bright golden thread, thick and strong, running
through from end to end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[113] Isaiah xi. 1-9; xxxii. 1-6.</p><p>[114] Micah iv. 1-8.</p><p>[115] Isaiah xi. 11-16; xxvii. 12-13.</p></div><p>It will come through that spared remnant.
The old stump will put out a new shoot. It
will be through the coming of a great king,
who will prove to be their greatest king,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><span class="snlabel">[113]</span> and
will reign not only over Israel, but over all
nations as tributary to Israel, with Jerusalem
as the capital city both of Israel and of the
whole earth.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><span class="snlabel">[114]</span> At its beginning there will be a
gathering of Israel from among all the nations
where they have been scattered.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><span class="snlabel">[115]</span> To assist these
scattered pilgrims to get to their own land, the
tongue of the Egyptian sea on the southwest is
to be destroyed; and the waters of the Euphrates
on the extreme east are to be so scattered or
dried up that men can walk over dry-shod.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[116] Zechariah xii. 10-14.</p><p>[117] Jeremiah xxxi. 8-19, 33, 34.</p><p>[118] Isaiah xxvi. 19; Daniel xii. 2.</p></div><p>When the great king comes there will be
genuine penitence among the people over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Page 167]</a></span>
past sins,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><span class="snlabel">[116]</span> and they will become a wholly changed
people.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><span class="snlabel">[117]</span> Israel will be a nation converted by
the power of the Holy Spirit through the conversion
of the people individually. There will
be at this time a resurrection of God's people
who have died.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><span class="snlabel">[118]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[119] Micah iv. 1-2.</p><p>[120] Isaiah xxv. 7</p><p>[121] Isaiah iv. 2-5.</p></div><p>The new reign and kingdom is to be one of
great spiritual enlightenment to all nations.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><span class="snlabel">[119]</span>
There will be everywhere a new, remarkable
openmindedness to God and His truth.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><span class="snlabel">[120]</span> And
there will be the same visible evidence of the
presence of God at Jerusalem as when the pillar

That wondrous presence-cloud is to be

<p>This sounds to our ears like the highly coloured
visionary dream of some over-enthusiastic
Hebrew. Yet this is a calm statement of what
is found here. And be it keenly marked, it is
a picture which the godly Hebrew of the old
time never lost sight of. <i>This is the first thing</i>
that stands out in these prophetic pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[122] Isaiah xxiv. 1-13, 17-20; ii. 12-19; Micah vii. 15-17.</p><p>[123] Zechariah xii. 1-9; xiv. 1-2.</p><p>[124] Isaiah xiii. 1-13.</p></div><p><i>The second thing</i> stands out distinctly. Preceding
this wondrous kingdom <i>the earth will be
visited by terrible judgments</i>.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><span class="snlabel">[122]</span> There is an
awfully dark shadow before the blaze of light
breaks out. A terrific storm will come before
the sun shines out in its new strength. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Page 168]</a></span>
nations will combine to make war against the
Jew. Their forces will be gathered at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><span class="snlabel">[123]</span>
At the head of the coalition will be a
power called Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><span class="snlabel">[124]</span> There will come a terrific
battle, victory for the coalition will seem
assured. The sufferings of the Jews will be
indescribable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[125] Zechariah xiv. 1-8.</p><p>[126] Isaiah xxiv. 21-22; xxvii. 1.</p></div><p>Then there will come a day never after to be
forgotten. In the midst of the indescribable
horrors of that battle, when things are at their
worst for the Jew, then comes the deliverance.
Suddenly Jehovah will appear out of the heavens,
with a great company of holy ones. His feet
will stand upon Mount Olivet to the east of
Jerusalem. There will be a terrible earthquake,
and an equally terrific shake-up of the heavenly
bodies. The luminaries, sun, moon, and stars,
will be darkened.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><span class="snlabel">[125]</span> There will be terrible judgments
visited not only upon the earth, but upon
the evil spirit powers.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><span class="snlabel">[126]</span> Repeated emphasis is
put upon the judgment to be visited upon
Babylon.</p>

<p>All this will sound like a veritable fairy tale
to many who are not familiar with this Book
of God; the unlikeliest thing imaginable. Yet
this is the thing seriously set forth throughout
these old prophetic pages. I have given a few
references in footnotes. But these few scattered
passages of themselves will not give an
adequate conception of what these pages hold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Page 169]</a></span></p>

<p>There is all the fascination of a novel, and
immensely more and deeper fascination than any
novel, in reading these prophetic pages repeatedly
in the way already spoken of till their mere
contents become somewhat familiar. Then taking
paper and pencil, running through again, and
drawing off patiently and carefully, item after
item of these prophecies plainly not yet fulfilled,
and then slowly and painstakingly put
them together in what would be a simple, logical
order.</p>

<p>It will be helpful, in reading, to remember
that it is a common thing with these writers
to speak of a future thing as already past. It
is a bit of the intensity that sees the thing that
is yet to come as already accomplished. And
one should discern between the immediate thing
that may likely occur in that generation and the
far-distant thing. A careful noting of the language
will make the difference clear.</p>

<p>This is the second thing that stands out, the
visitation of judgments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[127] Jeremiah xxx. 7-8.</p><p>[128] Daniel xii. 1.</p></div><p>Then there is <i>a third thing</i>. This terrible
visitation of judgments comes in connection
with, and at the close of, <i>a time of great persecution
of the Jew</i> by the nations. Jeremiah
speaks of it as the time of Jacob's trouble,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><span class="snlabel">[127]</span> and
the Man of Fire tells Daniel that there will be
a time of trouble <i>such as never was since there
was a nation even to that same time</i>.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><span class="snlabel">[128]</span> This persecution
of the Jew, and the visitation of judgments
on the earth as a deliverance from it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</a></span>
are connected with the setting up of the
Kingdom.</p>

<p>These are the three things that stand dominantly
out in these prophetic pages as distinctly-future,
the great Jew persecution unprecedented
in intensity, the visitation of terrible judgments
on the earth, and the coming of a glorious kingdom.
And the three are connected. We know
that no events have yet taken place that at all
satisfy the language used of these three connected
events.</p>

<p>This is the simple outline of expected coming
events with which the thoughtful reader of God's
Word is supposed to be familiar. The reverent
student of God's promises and plans and revelations
would naturally have all this clear and fresh
in his mind as he turns to open the pages of the
prophetic book of the New Testament.</p>

<h4>Forecast of the Great Storm.</h4>

<p>Now it is <i>of intense interest</i> to note that our
Lord Jesus speaks of these same three things,
at much length, and with much emphasis; the
persecution, the visitation of judgments, and
the kingdom. It came to me as a great surprise
and with startling force when I realized, after
gathering out this summary from the Old Testament,
that the three things that stand out so
sharply there are the very things Jesus speaks
of here with such fulness and emphasis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[129] Matthew xxiv.-xxv; Mark xiii; Luke xxi.</p></div><p>He puts special emphasis on the time of persecution
as of unprecedented horror and ferocity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Page 171]</a></span>
He plainly indicates that this will be directed
not only against the Jew, but against His own
followers. Three times this talk of His on
Olivet just before His death is given at much
length.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><span class="snlabel">[129]</span> That talk is given to a little group of
Jewish disciples who have broken with the Jewish
leaders, and who become the great leaders of
the Church formed at Pentecost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[130] Matthew xxiv. 21, 29.</p><p>[131] Mark xiii. 19.</p><p>[132] Revelation vii. 14 literally.</p></div><p>He speaks of that terrible experience as
&quot;great tribulation,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><span class="snlabel">[130]</span> &quot;such as there hath not
been the like from the beginning of the creation
which God created until now, nor ever shall
be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><span class="snlabel">[131]</span> We shall find it spoken of in this book
of Revelation as &quot;the tribulation, the great
one.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><span class="snlabel">[132]</span> It has come to be spoken of commonly
as &quot;the tribulation&quot; and &quot;the great tribulation.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[133] Leviticus xxvi. 14-39.</p><p>[134] Deuteronomy xxviii. 15-68.</p><p>[135] Deuteronomy xxxii.</p></div><p>With all this fresh in mind, a run back through
the Old Testament brings out that it is spoken
of there much more than we may have realized.
The warning to Israel, at Sinai, as they made
the covenant of allegiance with God, of the bitter
punishment that would come if they were untrue,
has seemed many times as though couched
in very intense, almost extreme language.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><span class="snlabel">[133]</span> But
it is found to fit into these later descriptions of
this great tribulation to come. That warning is
repeated, in as intense words and with a greater
fulness, by Moses in his series of farewell talks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</a></span>
in the Plains of Moab,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><span class="snlabel">[134]</span> and it runs through the
song he left for their use.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><span class="snlabel">[135]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[136] Daniel iii.</p></div><p>The experiences of the people of Israel in
Egypt are found to be an illustration of the
coming experience at the end, great persecution
and suffering, then great deliverance through a
visitation of judgment upon their persecutors,
and great revelation of God's glory following.
And the experience of the three young Hebrew
exiles in Babylon comes to mind. They went
through the fire, seven times heated, and they
had a marvellous deliverance, and then high
promotion.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><span class="snlabel">[136]</span></p>

<p>Certain Psalms shine with new light in the
light of this terrible truth. Chief among these
is the Ninety-first. Quite likely it grew up out
of the experience of Israel at the last before
leaving Egypt. It, of course, has its practical
use in one's daily life. But the vividness and
intensity of its meaning will probably never be
realized as during the coming tribulation days.
Nor will the exultant note running through the
nine Psalms immediately following it be appreciated
as by those experiencing deliverance when
the tribulation is over. The Forty-sixth Psalm,
and the Psalms of praise immediately following
it, likewise seem to get new light.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that very much, all through
this Book of Psalms, will be understood and
appreciated fully only by the generation of God's
people that go through the tribulation and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Page 173]</a></span>
the deliverance following. Much of the old Book
of God is quite meaningless to the Christian who
has had no tribulation <i>experience</i>. That is, I
mean who has never known opposition in his
Christian faith, or who has slipped easily along
when there is opposition.</p>

<p>The outstanding features in the Old Testament
of this great experience are terrible persecution
of the Jew, deliverance at the very worst
pitch of extremity, by a visitation of judgment
on their enemies, and by Jehovah coming in person
for their deliverance; and then the great
Kingdom following.</p>

<p>The outstanding features spoken of by our
Lord Jesus in His Olivet talk agree with this,
but go much more into detail, especially about
the tribulation. The tribulation will be <i>preceded</i>
by wars, rumors of wars, famines, earthquakes,
and persecution. There will be many false religious
teachers, many Christians untrue to their
faith, and a great increase of wickedness. This
is a sort of foreshadowing.</p>

<p>The tribulation itself will find all this enormously
intensified. It will <i>begin</i> with some astonishing
act of blasphemy in the temple in
Jerusalem, run its terrible course, and close
with a series of judgment-events, earthquake,
heavens shaken, and great distress, ending in the
visible appearance of the Lord Jesus Himself,
out of heaven on the clouds. And this will be
a signal for great penitential mourning among
the people on the earth.</p>

<p>This, then, is the simple, broad outline with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</a></span>
which the thoughtful reader of God's Word
would naturally be familiar as he turns to this
prophetic book at the end to get our Lord's last
message to His followers.</p>

<h4>Getting a Broad, Clear Outlook.</h4>

<p>As we turn now again to the book of Revelation
it will help us to remember the general plan
followed in its writing. It is like a series of dissolving
views of the same scene, each of which
lets us see the same thing from a different point
of view.</p>

<p>This is a simple teaching rule for getting a
clear grasp of what is being taught. We are
familiar with it in the Bible. The story of creation
is told in the first chapter of Genesis, and
then told again in the second chapter with details
not given in the first, the two together presenting
the complete story. The historical books
of Chronicles present one view of the kingdom
of Israel, the official. The books of the Kings
give another look at the same period; and the
prophetic books a wholly different view as seen
by these rarely spiritually minded men of God.
Daniel is shown four visions of future events,
all covering the same general stretch of events,
but with a fuller description, here of one part
and there of another. The four Gospels are a
familiar illustration of the same principle in
teaching and story-telling. This is the plan followed
here.</p>

<p>I was impressed anew with the practical value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Page 175]</a></span>
of this method one day in St. Petersburg. We
had gone to look at the panorama of the siege
of Sebastopol, then on exhibition in a huge,
round building. It will be remembered that the
British and French allied themselves with Turkey
and Sardinia in an attempt to restrain the
encroachments of Russia on Turkish territory.
The famous charge of Balaklava, immortalized
by Tennyson, is remembered as the most stirring
event of that war. Its chief event was the
siege of Sebastopol on the Crimea peninsula, in
the Black Sea.</p>

<p>At the panorama we stood as though on a
high central point in the city of Sebastopol, with
the view spreading out in all directions. To
the north lay the harbour with the Russian ships
securely bottled in by the attacking fleets. To
the west a body of French soldiers were retreating,
hotly pursued by Russian troops, while
in the distance British troops are hurrying to
the relief of the French.</p>

<p>Then we looked east, where the fighting was
going on at close range, the wounded being carried
away and the reserves hastening up to take
their places. And again we turned to the south,
where the battle raged fiercest. The face of the
commanding officer stood out so vividly. And
we almost shrank from the fierceness of the fire.
And the smell of powder almost seemed stifling.</p>

<p>And as I stood brooding afresh on the horrors
of inhuman war, I was tremendously impressed
that only by such successive views could I get
such a grasp of that memorable siege. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Page 176]</a></span>
a more intelligent and vivid understanding of
it than ever before.</p>

<p>And so it is that we may get a simple, clear,
and real grasp of the tremendous tribulation
time that is coming, that it is presented to us
in this fashion, first one distinct view, then another,
and another, till some understanding of
the whole begins to get hold of us.</p>

<p>We have seen the Lord Jesus, in the vision in
chapters four and five, as He comes forward
to take an advance step. We have seen the tremendous
outburst of praise in heaven as He
steps forward. This step and scene are in
heaven. The earth is wholly unaware of it
<i>at that moment</i>.</p>

<p>Now all that follows is connected directly
with that advance step. This is the significant
thing to get clearly fixed in mind. At the present
time our Lord Jesus is still walking among
the candlestick Churches watching and waiting.
We are still in that waiting time. The Holy
Spirit still dwells in the Church on earth.</p>

<p>At some time in the future, no one knows,
nor can know, just when, the Lord Jesus will
rise up in readiness for an advance move. He
will withdraw the Holy Spirit from the Church
up into His presence again &quot;before the throne.&quot;
<i>Then in connection with this advance step</i> there
will occur on the earth the things spoken of in
these pages following. This is the tremendous
fact to keep clear, the immediate connection
between these happenings on earth and His new
move in heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Page 177]</a></span></p>

<p>We come now to these happenings on earth.
There are seven distinct views given here in
this section, chapters six to the end of the book.
There is a great detail in description which it
would be both instructive and interesting to
study out. But we want to get at the essential
things. And so we will give our time and
thought to these essentials.</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus is represented as about to
take possession of His realm. The first step is
a dispossessing of the claimants in possession.
This furnishes the key to what follows. The
descriptions are of the process of cleaning out
the evil forces. At the close of this we find Him
taking possession (in chapter twenty) and reigning
over the earth.</p>

<p>These descriptions make it clear at once that
this is the tribulation so much spoken of in these
preceding pages. What follows fits so into what
has been spoken of that the identification seems
complete. The thing our Lord Jesus is revealing
here tallies with what He had told John before
on Olivet.</p>

<p>There comes first a general description of the
whole period (chapters vi.-vii.). Then follows a
description of <i>how</i> these happenings will come.
It will be through the withdrawal of restraint
and so the loosening out of evil (chapters viii.-ix.).
During this whole period there will be a
special faithful witnessing on earth, in the midst
of the riot of evil, to God and His truth (chapter
xi.).</p>

<p>A detailed outline of the run of events fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Page 178]</a></span>lows,
giving much additional information, picturing
the rise and characteristics of the leader of
the tribulation time, and the manner of its close
(chapters xii.-xiv.). There follows this a description
of the judgments and the supreme contest
with which the period closes (chapters xv.-xvi.).
There is a description of the organized
system of evil, and then of the fall of the capital
of the system (chapters xvii.-xviii.) And then
follows the actual coming of our Lord Jesus, the
setting up of the kingdom, and subsequent events
(chapters xix.-xxii.).</p>

<h4>A General Look at the Storm and Its Close.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[137] Chapters vi.-vii.</p><p>[138] Chapter xix.</p></div><p>We turn now to <i>the first</i> of these.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><span class="snlabel">[137]</span> It begins
with a crowned One seated on a white horse
going forth conquering and to conquer. This
description agrees with the much fuller description
of the Lord Jesus near the end of the book,
as he goes to the earth for the decisive close of
the tribulation.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><span class="snlabel">[138]</span></p>

<p>This gives fresh emphasis to the fact that
what follows is the direct result of His advance
step. At once there follows on earth a time
of war, famine, death, and of persecution to the
death of God's people. There is no hint as to
how long this goes on. It is brought to a close
with an earthquake and an equally terrific disturbance
of the heavens, the sun, moon, and
stars, something unknown before.</p>

<p>The utmost consternation is created on earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Page 179]</a></span>
All conditions of men, crowned kings, merchant
princes, men of autocratic power financially and
politically and socially, join with the humblest
in hiding themselves in the great holes made by
the earthquake. They feel that the time of judgment
has come, and they are not ready for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[139] Isaiah ii. 10-22.</p></div><p>The description of their terror tallies remarkably
with the prophetic language used by
Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><span class="snlabel">[139]</span> even as the whole description fits into
our Lord's Olivet talk. This is seen to be a
general, rapid vision of the whole tribulation
period.</p>

<p>Then there follows what clearly seems to be
a parenthesis fitting in just before the great
earthquake. The earth and sea have been terribly
torn up by the earthquake. This parenthesis
begins with a command that the earth and
sea be not hurt until certain things have taken
place.</p>

<p>This fits the two events of the parenthesis in
just before the ruinous earthquake takes place.
The two events are of a radically different sort
from what has just been told. They are thus
put by themselves, and the run of evil and of
judgment upon it, put by itself, so keeping these
two quite clear, following the general plan of
the book.</p>

<p>There are two events in this parenthesis.
There is what is called the &quot;sealing&quot; of a certain
number of the Hebrew tribes <i>on the earth</i>.
Twelve thousand of each tribe are sealed, making
a total of one hundred and forty-four thousand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Page 180]</a></span>
The word &quot;seal&quot; is used in two senses in the
Bible, as a means of fastening up a writing or
roll, and, in the New Testament, commonly for
the presence of the Holy Spirit in a human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[140] II Corinthians i. 22; Ephesians i. 13; iv. 30.</p></div><p>The seal in this second sense was a mark of
ownership. Paul tells us that we are sealed with
the Holy Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><span class="snlabel">[140]</span> so indicating that we belong
to the Lord Jesus, who gives us this evidence of
His ownership. If this simple, natural meaning
be taken here, it would mean that at this time
the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon the
Jew. The spiritual regeneration spoken of so
frequently in the prophetic pages takes place at
this time.</p>

<p>The significance of the numbers should be noticed.
Twelve is the number commonly used
in the Bible, for corporate completeness, to indicate
that a group is complete. Twelve times
twelve would simply represent a fully completed
corporate number. That is to say, upon the
entire body of Jews then living on the earth
the Holy Spirit is poured out, thus marking them
once again as God's peculiar people, restored
fully to favour after the long national rejection.</p>

<p>The second event is of equally intense interest,
indeed to us of non-Jewish birth it has yet
greater interest. John is up in heaven. It is
from that point of view that he sees. Now he
is suddenly startled. All at once there appears
before his eyes a group he had not seen before.
He describes it as a great multitude, actually
countless, out of all the peoples of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Page 181]</a></span>
earth, a great polyglot polyracial world company.</p>

<p>They are clothed in white, holding the conqueror's
palm in their hands, and singing, making
wondrous music. John is getting another taste
of the music of heaven. And their singing is a
signal for a fresh outburst of praise by the
angels, the elders, and the living creatures. All
this seems to occur suddenly, this appearance of
this new company before the throne.</p>

<p>John gazes spellbound, wondering who these
are, and where they come from, and what this
means. And he is told that these are they that
come out of the tribulation, the great one, down
on the earth. Then in a few exquisitely tender,
heart-touching words their happiness is described.</p>

<p>These two events occur just before the terrible
earthquake and the shake-up of the earth's
heavenly bodies. Just before the judgment that
closes the tribulation this double event takes
place, the conversion of the Jews, and the catching
away out of the tribulation distress on
earth, up into the presence of the throne, of the
followers of our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>We remember that that great Jew, Paul, was
converted by the appearance of Jesus in the
heavens above him. We remember that in the
Olivet talk Jesus says that His followers will
so be gathered up to Himself at the time of His
second coming. These two events, taking place
here, tell us what has happened down on the
earth. In his vision John, being in heaven, sees
these things as they appear from above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Page 182]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the first view of the tribulation. It
begins with the moment when our Lord Jesus
up in heaven begins action, describes the characteristics
of the tribulation on earth, and closes
with the national regeneration of Israel, and
the catching up from earth of Christ's true
followers.</p>

<h4>Evil Let Loose.</h4>

<p>The <i>second view</i> runs through chapters eight
and nine. Chapters ten and eleven to the close
of verse thirteen make a distinct parenthesis.
And then this view is picked up again at eleven,
fourteen, and runs to the close of that chapter.
But this final bit in chapter eleven is merely a
connecting link with what comes later. Practically
the whole of this view is in chapters eight
and nine.</p>

<p>It closes with an earthquake, so connecting it
with the final event in the first view. It begins
with a period of prolonged silence, which would
seem to answer to the hush in the great volume
of praise in the first view, when the Lamb takes
the sealed roll. So it carries us back to the same
starting-point as there.</p>

<p>There is first a striking scene before the
throne, where John sees a golden altar. On this
there is being offered incense, which is said to
be added to the prayers of all the saints. Incense
and prayers rise together before God.
Then an angel pours some of the fire of this
prayer-altar into the earth, and a storm follows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Page 183]</a></span>
So these two views, first and second, have another
common starting-point, the beginning of a
storm.</p>

<p>This is a very suggestive scene. The prayers
of all the saints, both in earth and heaven, have
a decided restraining influence over evil down
on earth at the present time. At the close
they will become a decisive influence in the
cleaning-up process on earth, and the bringing
in of the new order.</p>

<p>Then follows a fourfold description of distressing
events on earth, which are caused by
fiery influences coming out of the heavens. The
language used seems to make clear that it is
through a loosening out of the powers of evil
that the tribulation comes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[141] Isaiah ii. 2.</p><p>[142] Revelation xvii. 9-10.</p><p>[143] Jeremiah li. 25.</p><p>[144] Revelation viii. 10, see also ix. 1; Isaiah xiv. 12-15.</p></div><p>In the picture language of the vision, &quot;a great
mountain burning with fire was cast into the
sea,&quot; with injurious results to water, to life,
and to shipping. A mountain is a common
figure in the Bible for a great ruling power. So
Israel is called by Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><span class="snlabel">[141]</span> The seventeenth
chapter of Revelation speaks of seven kingdoms
as seven mountains.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><span class="snlabel">[142]</span> In Jeremiah, Babylon,
which is spoken of repeatedly and typically as
being the embodiment of evil and of opposition
to God, is called: &quot;O destroying mountain ...
which destroyest all the earth, (I) will make of
thee a burnt mountain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><span class="snlabel">[143]</span> It speaks here also
of &quot;a great star,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><span class="snlabel">[144]</span> burning as a torch,&quot; that fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Page 184]</a></span>
upon the rivers and makes them bitter as
wormwood. These two things seem to suggest
clearly that the great hurt done to sea and
vegetation, to all life, and through the obscuring
of the heavenly lights, is a result directly
of the powers of evil having been loosened
out.</p>

<p>The long restraint upon evil through the presence
of the Holy Spirit in the Church is now
withdrawn in the withdrawal of the Spirit. His
withdrawal is practically an answer to the tacit
prayer both of world and Church. That prayer
is being answered. The &quot;One&quot; who restraineth
has been withdrawn. This it is that makes the
tribulation on its negative side. The awful character
of the demons from the pit is so utterly
beyond human experience up to that time that
there seem no adequate words to describe
them.</p>

<p>The Gospels are full of the awful activity of
demons on earth in possessing men. In our own
land there is not wanting plenty of evidence of
men horribly possessed by demons. In the older
countries of Europe this experience is much
more marked. But it is in heathen lands that
it is most marked, where even the very air seems
charged with evil forces, as though these unseen
demons swarmed about.</p>

<p>Yet all this sort of thing is now under restraint.
What it will mean to have that restraint
withdrawn, and the horrid hordes here described
free to do as they will, no imagination can depict.
This is well called the first <i>woe</i>, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Page 185]</a></span>
awful woe it will be. Mercifully there is a time
limit set on this demon activity.</p>

<p>Following this comes the loosing out of another
horde of demons, as difficult of description,
and yet more terrible. They seem countless,
yet there is a limit to their numbers. The supreme
Hand is never wholly withdrawn. These
have power to kill as well as to torment. This
is the second woe. It is most strikingly noticeable
that neither of these things has influence
to make men penitent.</p>

<p>The last item of this view is given in chapter
xi. 14-19. The announcement is made that the
sovereignty of the world is transferred to our
Lord and His Christ. The temple of God is seen
open, and some further action takes place, but
the detail of it is reserved for another view.
Such is the terrible sight in the second view of
the tribulation time. Evil is loosened out, apparently
unrestrained, and yet under restraint.
This it is that makes the tribulation on its positive
side.</p>

<p>The parenthesis in the description of this view
has been spoken of. It runs through chapters
ten and eleven to the close of verse thirteen, and
contains two chief things. The first is a little
group of three items. There is a fresh description
of our Lord Jesus as He is seen standing
with one foot on the sea and the other upon
the earth, and holding a little open book. Then
seven thunders roar out. John is about to write,
but is told not to. That terrific storm coming
is far greater than can be told. Then comes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Page 186]</a></span>
solemn declaration that there will be no further
delay, but that at once shall be finished up this
terrible time of judgment. Then follows a personal
word to John. These three items make up
chapter ten.</p>

<h4>God's Faithful Witnesses.</h4>

<p>Then comes the second thing, in chapter eleven
on to verse thirteen, which proves to be <i>the third
view</i> of the tribulation. It shows that during the
whole of this tribulation time there will be a
special faithful witness being borne to God and
His truth. As the Holy Spirit is being withdrawn
from the Church, these two men begin
their special ministry of witnessing.</p>

<p>The place of that witness will be Jerusalem.
But recent events will have brought a greatly
diversified population to that city from all parts
of the world. So that the witness becomes
world-wide in its immediate reach, and probably
in the reports of it that go out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[145] In regard to Elijah, see Malachi iv. 5-6. John the
Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, and
of him our Lord said, &quot;this is he who was to come.&quot;
</p><p>
Yet the events of judgment spoken of in Malachi did
not take place when John the Baptist and Jesus came.
The events spoken of prophetically in connection with
His coming are divided into two groups, those of
graciousness, finding fulfilment at the first coming, those
of judgment followed by graciousness, at the second
coming. So John the Baptist fulfils the Elijah part at
the first of these two; in all probability Elijah himself
at the second part, <i>i.e.</i>, &quot;before the great and <i>terrible</i>
day of Jehovah come.&quot;
</p><p>
In regard to Enoch, the passage in Jude, verse 14,
is of significance. The language, &quot;Enoch prophesied,
... the Lord <i>came</i>, etc.,&quot; is probably spoken in the
sense, familiar in the Bible, of a future action seen
as already done. Here Enoch is spoken of as prophesying
or preaching, <i>not</i> to the people before the Flood,
but to a certain class of men belonging to Jude's generation,
that is to the Church generation. The likeliest
meaning of the words is that Enoch, the seventh
and so on, <i>will</i> prophesy, saying, &quot;behold the Lord
<i>cometh</i>,&quot; and so on to close of verse 15.</p></div>
<p>While there is good reason for thinking that
these two witnesses may be Enoch and Elijah,
the two men of Bible record, one before the
Flood and one after, who were distinctively
God's witnesses, and were taken away without
death, yet it is best not to stop over a matter
that has been and is apt to be a matter of mere
idle speculative talk.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><span class="snlabel">[145]</span> The thing worthy of note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Page 187]</a></span>
is that as the Holy Spirit's distinctive witness
is withdrawn there will be these two special witnesses
sent to Jerusalem for a witness that will
be world-wide in its extent and influence. Such
is God's gracious patience and longsuffering.</p>

<p>These two men are clothed in mourning as a
part of their witness. They have miraculous
power in protecting themselves against attack,
and in withholding rain, and sending plagues
among the people, and in turning water into
blood, to give force and effect to their testimony.
Their witness continues through twelve
hundred and sixty days.</p>

<p>John had already been told that Jerusalem
would be trodden under foot by the nations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Page 188]</a></span>
forty-two months. We are apt to think that
it has been trodden under foot or desecrated by
the nations for an immensely longer period. But
prophecy never gives any reckoning of time for
Israel, except when Israel is an organized nation.
It is concerned with telling Jewish <i>national</i>
events.</p>

<p>At this time the Jews have their national organization
again in Palestine. For forty-two
months after the nation has been newly set up
the city will be so trodden under the desecrating
feet of the nations. This is the first hint of
time we have had. The witnessing and the desecration
of the holy city will continue side by
side for three and a half years.</p>

<p>At the end of this period evil will be given
full swing over these witnesses. They are killed
and their bodies left lying in the streets, while
the international crowds make merry because
their tormentors, as these two are called, are
gone. Then before the terror-stricken gaze of
these crowds the two men come to life, and are
caught up into the heavens. Is this the moment
when all are caught up? Quite possibly.
Then comes the terrible earthquake as at the
end of the other two views.</p>

<p>The one distinctive thing told here is that
during the tribulation, in the midst of all the
blasphemous reign of unrestrained wickedness,
there will be the unbroken, faithful witnessing.
This seems to explain why the account comes as
a parenthesis in the account of the awful riot
of evil. During the worst of the evil there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Page 189]</a></span>
go on unbroken the faithful, gracious testimony
of God's truth and love.</p>

<h4>The Lawless Leader.</h4>

<p><i>The fourth view</i> takes the longest sweep of
any, thus far, goes into much more detail, and
gives much fresh information. It runs through
chapters twelve to fourteen. In the intensely
picturesque language of a woman arrayed in the
most glorious splendour and dignity and power
imaginable the nation of Israel is depicted.</p>

<p>This woman is with child. In more intensely
dramatic language Satan is pictured as standing
before the woman waiting to destroy her child
as soon as born. The child is born, a man-child,
who is to rule all the nations with autocratic
sway. He is caught up to heaven, and his
mother flees into the wilderness from the serpent.
This is the opening action of this view.</p>

<p>The meaning lies open on the face. Israel
gave birth to the man Jesus, who foiled all the
attacks of Satan and ascended to heaven. The
old prophetic characteristic of connecting events
far apart without reference to intervening time
is marked here. The long interval between the
break-up of the Jew nation and its taking shape
again as a nation, which has lasted nineteen
hundred years roughly, comes between the last
word of verse five and the first word of verse
six.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[146] Revelation xii. 1-6.</p></div><p>The prophetic writing takes no reckoning of
Israel, except as a nation. The woman fleeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Page 190]</a></span>
into the wilderness is Israel organized again as
a nation suffering persecution. She is so persecuted
for twelve hundred and sixty days, but
divinely protected and preserved. Such is the
first act of the drama pictured here.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><span class="snlabel">[146]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[147] Revelation xii. 7-17.</p></div><p>Then we are told <i>why</i> the woman flees, that
is, the explanation of this special persecution
of the Jew this time.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><span class="snlabel">[147]</span> Satan has had his headquarters
somewhere in the heavens, below God's
throne, but above the earth. Now, after a conflict,
he is cast out of heaven, down to the earth.
Here is a third event that comes approximately
at the beginning of the tribulation time, Satan
is cast down to the earth.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is withdrawn from the Church
up to heaven, so removing the restraint upon
evil. Satan is cast out of heaven and comes
down to earth. Thus there is a double intensifying
of evil on the earth, the withdrawal of
restraint, and the presence of the evil one himself.
And as the witness of the Holy Spirit is
withdrawn the special witness of the two men in
Jerusalem begins.</p>

<p>The defeat of Satan in this heavenly conflict
draws out a burst of praise from the upper hosts.
It is because of the great victory of our Lord
Jesus in His death that this victory is gotten.
They overcome because of the blood of the
Lamb, <i>and</i> the word of their testimony, <i>and</i>
they loved not their lives unto death,&mdash;a threefold
cord that could never, and can never, be
broken or successfully resisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Page 191]</a></span></p>

<p>This explains the special persecution at this
time of the reshaped Jewish nation. It is the
outburst of the rage of the freshly defeated
Satan. But the Jew is protected. The armies
that would swallow the Jew up are swallowed up
by the great earthquake that closes the tribulation
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[148] Revelation xii.</p></div><p>The length of this persecution is put in two
different ways, twelve hundred and sixty days,
and &quot;time, times, and half a time.&quot; This latter
phrase seems to be an old Oriental or Hebrew
way of saying a year, two years, and half
a year. The same length of time is expressed
in yet another way in the eleventh chapter, forty
and two months. The time is thus put in three
different ways, that we may know surely that it
means just plain three and a half years of our
common time. It is significant that the dragon
makes war with &quot;the rest&quot; of the woman's
seed. This can only mean the Church, which
of course was born in the Jewish nation. This
is the first run of events in this view.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><span class="snlabel">[148]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[149] Revelation xiii.</p></div><p>Then follows a description of the awful leader
of evil during the tribulation time.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><span class="snlabel">[149]</span> It is significant
that, as Satan is cast out of heaven down
to the earth, this leader appears among men.
He has great intelligence and power and is the
very embodiment of blasphemy. He is described
as a strange mixture of wild beasts, having the
chief characteristic strength of each, the cunning
of the leopard, the feet of the bear, and the mouth
of the lion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Page 192]</a></span></p>

<p>He is the personal representative on earth
among men of Satan. There is something
strangely uncanny in the suggestion that he is
some former leader, who died, and is now raised
from the dead. There seems to be nothing too
daring for Satan to attempt in his impious opposition
to God. This leader comes into great
prominence and power. All the world wonders
after him. And they worship Satan, who is recognized
as giving his power to this notorious
leader.</p>

<p>He comes to be accepted as the world ruler,
and is commonly worshipped by the people. And
he not only persecutes God's people, but overcomes
them. A limit of time is set to his sway.
It is the same as already noted for Jerusalem
being desecrated, for God's two witnesses, and
for the persecution of the Jew, <i>i.e.</i>, forty and
two months, three and a half years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[150] Chapter xiii. 9-10.</p></div><p>It is striking that in the midst of the description
of his terrible reign there comes a word that
sounds like an echo from those messages to the
Churches. &quot;If any man hath an ear, let him
hear.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><span class="snlabel">[150]</span> Then the word goes on warning, pleading,
and encouraging. In the midst of these
blasphemous conditions every man must do as
he personally decides. He may yield to this evil
and become a captive of evil, bound hand and
foot. He may try to use the world's weapons
in fighting God's battle, but will find himself
outmatched in their use. He may rise to the
true level, and steadfastly cling to his faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Page 193]</a></span>
and endure, and by faith be victorious in the
end.</p>

<p>The description goes on to tell of the blasphemous
worship demanded of all. This leader
has an assistant or lieutenant to whom he deputizes
great power. He makes an image to his
chief, and demands all to worship at this shrine.
He has supernatural power, that is, devilishly
supernatural. He performs great miracles, even
calling down fire from heaven. He gives breath
to the image and makes it speak. And he punishes
with death any one who refuses this blasphemous
worship to the leader and his image.
And every one is required to have a mark on his
hand or his forehead as indicating his loyalty
to the leader. Whoever refuses is unable to
buy or sell. It is the boycott principle carried
to the last extreme.</p>

<p>While God's two witnesses are doing miracles
by divine power this lieutenant is doing them
by devilish power. So the fearful account goes
on. One can easily imagine the vast crowds
swayed by the idolatrous worship, and the intense
suffering and distress among those who
insist on being steadfast and true in their faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[151] Revelation xiv. 1-5.</p></div><p>Now in the midst of all this terrible scene
John is suddenly and tremendously startled by
something else.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><span class="snlabel">[151]</span></p>

<p>In the vision John is in heaven looking down
on these scenes on the earth. Now his attention
is attracted by a scene that suddenly takes
place before his eyes in heaven. It is a scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Page 194]</a></span>
of wondrous winsomeness and beauty. It stands
out in sharpest contrast with what is going on
on the earth.</p>

<p>There's a great company standing around the
Lord Jesus, before the throne. They are singing
a wonderful song to the accompaniment of
harps, which they have. The volume of music is
like the voice of many waters, or like great
thunder. There is a simple, fine description of
the character of these singers. They are <i>pure</i>,
and they are <i>obedient</i>. In their purity they are
as undefiled virgins, the highest possible statement
of purity. And they follow the Lamb unquestioningly
whithersoever He goeth with
fullest obedience.</p>

<p>Who are these, and where have they come
from so suddenly, at this moment, into the presence
of the One on the throne? The description
tells just what has happened. When things are
at their devilish worst down on the earth the
Lord Jesus has caught up His own from the
earth. And they have become like Him in character,
for now they see Him face to face as He
is.</p>

<p>This recalls the scene, essentially the same,
back in the first view, in chapter seven, where the
great multitudes are suddenly seen before the
throne with palm branches, songs, and white
garments. It is the same company as there.
But there is a difference in telling the numbers.
<i>There</i> they are too many to be counted. <i>Here</i>
they are said to be a hundred and forty-four
thousand. It is symbolical, a picture number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Page 195]</a></span>
the number of full corporate completeness as
with the Spirit-baptized Jews in chapter seven.</p>

<p>The believers caught up out of the great
tribulation have been joined by the trusting
hearts of all time who have been waiting in the
Father's presence for this glad day. The number
is now complete of all from creation's earliest
dawn, who by grace have followed fully,
regardless of hindrance or opposition. This
great climax is thus seen by John in sudden
and sharp contrast with the climax of hellish
evil on the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[152] Revelation xiv. 6-20.</p></div><p>Then John is shown the steps by which this
climax is reached.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><span class="snlabel">[152]</span> Verses six to the close of
this chapter seem clearly to be a detail of what
has gone before, describing the steps by which
this climax is reached, and then reaching further
to the judgment upon the evil. During the
iniquitous scenes being enacted on earth an
angel is seen flying in mid-heavens calling to the
people on earth, in warning, to give their worship
and reverence to God only. The gracious
wooing of God never ceases.</p>

<p>Another angel follows, calling out that the
great system of iniquity, in which they are enmeshed,
is doomed. A third gives solemn warning
that those who yield to the terrible pressure,
and engage in the blasphemous worship, will be
surely and terribly punished. Again there comes
another echo of the strain of pleading in the
Church messages. In the midst of just such
conditions as prevail then, the saints can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Page 196]</a></span>
steady in keeping the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus.</p>

<p>And down into the awful persecution being
waged comes an encouraging voice from heaven.
There is special blessing from God on all those
who remain true, even unto death. There will
be sweetest rest for them, and their faithful
witnessing and suffering shall be all noted and
acknowledged and rewarded as they come up into
the Father's presence.</p>

<p>And then follows the blessed harvest of the
righteous whose wonderful arrival in heaven
has already been told in the opening scene of
this chapter. And then follows the awful harvest
of evil down on the earth, the visitation of
judgments coming at the very end of the persecution.</p>

<p>So closes this long remarkable view of the
tribulation. It connects back with the nation
of Israel. Its beginning is connected practically
with the casting of Satan down to earth. It
gives a description of the leader and the nature
of the persecution, and a brief statement of the
steps with which it ends. And it states in three
different ways that the length of time involved
is three and a half years.</p>

<h4>A Bitter Cup to Its Dregs.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[153] Revelation xv.-xvi.</p></div><p><i>The fifth view</i><a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><span class="snlabel">[153]</span> is, not of the whole tribulation
time as with these others, but of only a
part, the closing part. It speaks of the visitation
of judgments, the great climactic battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Page 197]</a></span>
and the earthquake, with which the period is
brought to its end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[154] Revelation xiv. 1-5.</p></div><p>It connects at the point in the fourth view<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><span class="snlabel">[154]</span>
where those who have been suffering in the tribulation
are seen standing before the throne singing
with harps. It is said that they are singing the
song of Moses, who had the experience of tribulation
and deliverance in Egypt, and the song
of the Lamb, who went through the worst
tribulation experience in His contest with Satan
and sin on our behalf.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[155] Revelation xi. 19.</p></div><p>It connects also with the close of the second
view,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><span class="snlabel">[155]</span> where the temple is seen opened and the
ark of the covenant is seen. That covenant is
now to receive further fulfilment. God never
forgets His promises and agreements. Seven
angels have seven golden bowls full of the wrath
of God. In this way is told the visitation of
judgments now described as taking place at this
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[156] Psalm xi. 6; lx. 3; lxxv. 8; Job xxi. 20; Isaiah li.
17, 22, 23; Jeremiah xxv. 15-17; Ezekiel xxiii. 31-33;
Habakkuk ii. 16; Zechariah xii. 2.</p></div><p>In the first view the picture is of <i>seals</i> being
broken or opened, which indicates the execution
of a document. The <i>trumpets</i> of the next view
indicate a commanding call to action; the seven
<i>thunders</i>, not written, a great storm. These
<i>bowls</i> or vials indicate the administration of a
dose of bitter-tasting medicine. The visitation of
judgments by God is commonly spoken of in
Scripture in this language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Page 198]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><span class="snlabel">[156]</span></p>

<p>Then follows the description of the judgments
upon men's persons, and everything concerning
their life. Men's bodies are diseased, the water
is unfit to drink, the food supply cut short; they
suffer with terrible heat, and then darkness. But
there is no penitence. The Euphrates is said to
be dried up, suggesting that it is the great river
at or near the world's centre of action. So, it is
said, the way is prepared for the kings that come
from the east.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[157] Isaiah xi. 15-16.</p></div><p>And the prophetic bit in Isaiah comes to mind
about men passing over the Euphrates at the
time of the great gathering of the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><span class="snlabel">[157]</span> As
though aroused by all this to bitterest opposition
there is increased demon activity, and through
it a great gathering of all nations, at a place
named in Palestine, for a great battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[158] Revelation vi. 15-17.</p></div><p>Then a terrible climax comes in the earthquake,
with which the first, second, and third
views closed. It is the worst earthquake ever
experienced. It centres in &quot;<i>the</i> great city,&quot;
Babylon, the capital of the whole system of
wickedness. With the storm is a terrible hail.
The description tallies with that in the close of
the first view,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><span class="snlabel">[158]</span> and with the vivid prophetic bit
in Isaiah ii. 10-22.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[159] Revelation xi. 14.</p></div><p>There's no suggestion of how much time all
this takes. The judgments visited on Egypt at
the deliverance of Israel are described at much
greater length, running into ten items. Yet all
could have occurred within five weeks, allowing
for brief intervals. Whether these judgments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Page 199]</a></span>
occur in succession, or all at once, or partly in
both ways, they could all come within a very
short time. This fifth view depicts the final
scene. It gives the visitation of judgments ending
the tribulation period, describes a great
pitched battle, in which all nations are involved,
and ends with the earthquake. This is the third
of the three great woes.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><span class="snlabel">[159]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[160] Chapters xvii. and xviii.</p></div><p><i>The sixth view</i> is of the great system of wickedness
in the world, through which the tribulation
comes, and which is judged at its close.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><span class="snlabel">[160]</span>
The description is full of details of great interest
and instructiveness, but we can only have time
at present for the essential thing being taught.
The Spirit takes John into a wilderness. To the
Spirit's eye wherever wickedness has sway,
whether vulgar or polished, political or commercial,
cunning or brazen, it is a wilderness.</p>

<p>Here is shown a woman gorgeously clothed,
prodigally bedecked with jewels, and having a
cup in her hand, made of gold, but full of vile
filth. Upon her forehead appears a description:
&quot;Mystery [or explanation of mystery], Babylon
the great, the mother of harlots and of
the abominations of the earth.&quot; This woman is
riding upon a strange beast; it is scarlet-colored,
with seven heads and ten horns, and full of blasphemous
names. This is the startlingly suggestive
picture.</p>

<p>Who is this woman? And what is this beast
upon which she is seated? The whole description
taken together suggests that she is meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Page 200]</a></span>
to stand for the whole system of wickedness
which has had such sway in the world from
earliest time until the end. And the beast represents
typically the dominant governmental powers.
The two have always worked together.
There has been a consistent unity of spirit and
of characteristic, and a persistent devilishness
marking the wickedness in the world throughout
the ages.</p>

<p>It has been as though there were an unseen
spirit power tirelessly at work <i>behind</i> all the
varied manifestations of evil. The dominant
characteristic always has been blasphemy of God.
It has controlled thrones and royal power, and
has had unlimited gold at its command. And it
has always been an enemy, subtle or open, cunning
or violent, of God and His people.</p>

<p>That system or genius of evil is represented
in the Old Testament as finding expression in
one great political power after another, but
chiefly in the power of Babylon. Babylon stands
typically in these older pages, not merely for the
great empire of the Euphrates, but for the unseen
spirit of evil lying behind that power, and
making use of it to carry through its own foul
purposes.</p>

<p>But that unseen evil spirit power has found
more than one agency to dominate and use.
Babylon long since passed off the stage as a
political factor. But the power of evil has not
ceased. It is distressing to note another great
organization behind and through which the power
of evil has worked. What is the system that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Page 201]</a></span>
has, for the past sixteen centuries, been supported
by the various great civil governments?</p>

<p>There is only one answer. It is the organization
known as &quot;the Christian Church.&quot; And
the term Church must be taken here in its fullest,
broadest meaning. Its great main stem historically
is the Roman Catholic Church. The
first great split-off was the Greek Orthodox
Church. The Church of England was a later
break-off. These, with the various government-ally
supported Churches, and those free of such
support, and various ancient primitive bodies,&mdash;these
all together make up the organization
known as &quot;the Church.&quot;</p>

<p>The two symbolical characteristics of this
woman and the two dominant characteristics of
this historical Church are the same. The Church
has been and is supported almost wholly by the
civil governments, and used by them in furthering
their policies. And it has been active in
persecuting to death the people of God who
would not yield to its domination. It has been
marked by intolerance of all not yielding to its
wishes, and especially of the Jew. That intolerance
has been carried not only to the extreme of
blood, but a riot of bloodshed. This is utterly
heart-breaking to realize and to repeat.</p>

<p>The woman is said to be &quot;drunken (1) with
the blood of the saints, and (2) with the blood
of the martyrs of Jesus.&quot; The twofold statement
is seen to cover the two great periods, before
Christ and since. And it covers also the
two great powers through which the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Page 202]</a></span>
evil has chiefly worked in those two periods.
But the name given first in the plains of Shinar,
and used characteristically of the God-defying
power of evil, is given here, Babylon. It will be
Babylon again at the very end after the Church
system is overthrown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[161] Revelation xvii. 8-12.</p></div><p>It is plainly said that the beast represents the
great civil or governmental power in its final
stage, the shape it will be in at the end when
these events occur.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><span class="snlabel">[161]</span> The chief dominating political
power of the world will have passed
through a succession of changes, seven kingdoms
successively following each other. At the end
there will be a combination of some sort, with
ten great subdivisions, and one great head over
all.</p>

<p>But at the last, the civil power will discard the
Church, and persecute it. The spirit of evil thus
gets embodiment typically in the great Babylon
power, then in the Church, and at the very last,
in a coalition of civil powers heading up in a
new Babylon.</p>

<p>Then follows announcement of the fall of
Babylon. The city is regarded here as the
earthly capital of the organized system of unseen
evil spirit power at work in the world. The
city and the system are inseparably allied. The
name Babylon is used in the Bible for both system
and city.</p>

<p>If the question be asked what city is meant
here, there can be but one answer. From the
twelfth of Genesis on the Bible never touches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Page 203]</a></span>
history, except as history touches Israel as a
nation. A thoughtful review of the book makes
this clear. And this book of Revelation is a
gathering-up of Bible threads, and only these.
There is only one city in the Bible record that
answers to the description here, &quot;the great city
which reigneth over the kings of the earth.&quot;
&quot;Babylon <i>the</i> great.&quot;</p>

<p>But the old Babylon lies in ruins. And its
ruined condition has been quoted as the fulfilment
of the famous passage in Isaiah xiii. 19-22.
It should be carefully noted that the present
conditions at the site of old Babylon do not seem
to satisfy fully the language of that passage.
It would seem to be another illustration of the
rare use of language in the Bible, which adapts
a passage accurately to one event, and then to a
second event, a long time afterward.</p>

<p>This would, of course, involve the rebuilding
of the old capital of the Euphrates. The reverent
student quietly notes the movements taking
place in that part of the world, but restrains mere
curious speculation, as he continues fervently
to pray, &quot;Thy kingdom come.&quot;</p>

<p>This eighteenth chapter of Revelation seems
like an echo of that intense twenty-first of Isaiah,
and indeed of a strain sounding all through the
prophetic books. One familiar with the old writings
is not surprised to find this echo; he expects
it. No echo of God's voice or purpose is
ever lost. God never loses any of the threads out
of His hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Page 204]</a></span></p>

<h4>Hallelujah! He Comes.</h4>

<p><i>The seventh view</i> presents the climax. It includes
from chapter nineteen to chapter twenty-two,
verse five. It presents in full the great scene
that closes this tribulation period; touches the
kingdom in a bare word so as to fit it into its
place in the scheme of events being outlined;
and then gives the final wind-up after the Kingdom
time is over. We want to look now at the
portion connected immediately with what has
just gone before, the description of the wondrous
close of the tribulation, in chapters nineteen,
verse one, to twenty, verse three.</p>

<p>John hears a great outburst of worship and
praise in heaven. It resembles the outburst
back in chapter five, when the Lamb took the
book. But it is seen to be yet greater than
that. Its joy and delight seem wholly unbounded.
Again the living creatures and the
four and twenty elders lead the song that bursts
out.</p>

<p>John tries to tell how great was the volume of
adoring song that fills all heaven. It is like
the voice of a great multitude, like the waters
that he had heard many a time breaking in
deafening roar on the rocky coast of Patmos,
like the mighty thunders which he had heard so
much in these visions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[162] Revelation i. 4, 8; iv. 8.</p><p>[163] Revelation xi. 17; xvi. 5.</p></div><p>And the song they sang explains the exuberance
of their singing, &quot;Hallelujah: for the Lord
our God, the Almighty <i>reigneth</i>.&quot; At last He
<i>reigneth</i>. In the earlier parts of the book God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Page 205]</a></span>
is spoken of as &quot;He who is and who was, and
<i>who cometh</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><span class="snlabel">[162]</span> As later events are described
that last part &quot;who cometh&quot; is significantly
dropped.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><span class="snlabel">[163]</span> Clearly at these points being described
He has come. Now the great realization
bursts out from countless voices, the Lord,
our God, the Almighty <i>reigneth</i>!</p>

<p>And John is bidden to write the words whose
refrain has filled such a place in hymns and
devout speech, &quot;Blessed are they that are bidden
to the marriage supper of the Lamb.&quot; And
the one who seems to be serving as John's guide
puts peculiar emphasis on all that is being revealed
by saying, &quot;these are true words of
God.&quot;</p>

<p>John is so overwhelmed that he falls down
to worship this one. And then he finds that
this is one of his own redeemed brothers of the
earth. And as He quietly bids John give his
worship to One only, He adds very significant
words: &quot;the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy.&quot; The whole genius and soul of all
this wealth of prophecy is to point men to our
Lord Jesus Christ, God to us.</p>

<p>And now comes the event toward which the
ages have looked. <i>The heavens open.</i> And <i>our
Lord Jesus appears</i> coming in glory to earth. At
last He comes. There's a wonderful description.
He comes as a conqueror, riding forth to judge
the earth righteously, and to make war on evil.
His eyes are as a flame of fire, and upon His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Page 206]</a></span>
head many diadems. He has a name indicating
that He is all alone in the experiences He has
been through, and in His character. He comes
as King of kings and Lord of lords, to rule all
the earth with a new absolutism, to right all
wrongs, and visit the indignant wrath of God
upon all sin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[164] Ezekiel xxxix. 17-20.</p></div><p>As He appears an angel gives warning of
what is coming. In words that are an echo of
Ezekiel's, long centuries before, he calls to
all the scavenger birds of the earth that haunt
battlefields to come to a great feasting time.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><span class="snlabel">[164]</span>
And John sees the vast armies of the nations of
the earth all gathered together for a last mighty
battle, under the leadership of the great leader
of lawlessness and his lieutenant.</p>

<p>And the utter impotence of their struggle
against God is revealed in the quietness and
brevity with which their defeat and capture are
told. Satan's great earth leader and his chief
who deceived the people with his miraculous
power, both are taken and forever put away.
And then Satan himself is chained and fastened
securely in the abyss. Such is the tremendous
consummation quietly told in a few lines. And
then follows the setting up of the glorious kingdom
on earth.</p>

<p>Whatever the immediate circumstances under
which the Second Psalm was penned, it will be
readily seen how it fits into this situation at the
end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Page 207]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;Why do the nations tumultuously assemble,<br />
And the peoples meditate a vain thing?<br />
The kings of the earth set themselves,<br />
And the rulers take counsel together,<br />
Against Jehovah and against His Anointed, saying,<br />
'Let us break their bonds asunder,<br />
And cast away their cords from us.'&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>But their efforts seem so puny, and the result
so one-sided, that</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh:<br />
The Lord will have them in derision.&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And we remember that, in these Revelation
pages, it is always with the sword of His mouth
that the Lord Jesus is said to fight, as we read
on:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;Then will He <i>speak</i> unto them in His wrath,<br />
And vex [or trouble] them in His sore displeasure; [saying]<br />
'Yet I have set <i>my</i> King<br />
Upon my holy hill of Zion.'&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Then the Son speaks:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;I will tell of the decree:<br />
Jehovah said unto me, 'thou art my Son;<br />
This day have I begotten thee.<br />
Ask of me and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance,<br />
And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;<br />
Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And the writer of the Psalms closed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Page 208]</a></span>
word of earnest counsel to the kings of earth:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
&quot;Now therefore be wise, O ye kings:<br />
Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br />
Serve Jehovah with fear,<br />
And rejoice with trembling [awe],<br />
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way,<br />
For His wrath will soon be kindled.<br />
Blessed are all they that take refuge in Him.&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that these seven views describe
(1) the general characteristics of the tribulation
time; (2) the way in which it comes, that
is, by the withdrawal of restraint and so the
loosing of evil; (3) the faithful witness being
borne throughout the period; (4) the great evil
leader and the character of the persecution he
wages; (5) the visitation of judgments upon
earth with the great gathering of nations to
battle against God; (6) the world system of evil;
and (7) the coming of our Lord Jesus to judge
evil and set up the kingdom.</p>

<h4>Still He Waits.</h4>

<p>It will at once be noted that these things group
up, naturally and easily, under <i>three headings</i>.
First, there is a terrible <i>persecution</i> of God's
people. This will end in a <i>visitation</i> of <i>judgments</i>,
including great plagues. There will be
a gathering of the armies of all nations, and a
great battle. It will end in a decisive defeat for
them by the personal coming of the Lord Jesus,
and will be accompanied by a terrific earthquake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Page 209]</a></span>
and an equally terrific shake-up of the heavenly
bodies connected with the earth, sun, moon, and
stars. Then comes the establishment of the
<i>Kingdom of God</i> upon earth. These three things
stand dominantly out.</p>

<p>It comes as a surprise to one who has not been
thinking especially about it, to find how these
three things are the same three that stood out
so prominently at the close of the study of
future items in the old prophetic books. It is
natural that it should be so, of course, since the
Book of God is one in its essential unity.</p>

<p>But there is a great fascination in finding the
parts to come together so simply and naturally.
As we gather up the Old Testament pages these
three things sift out and group together as distinctly
not yet fulfilled, and so future. As we
listen to our Lord Jesus talking, again these same
three items are emphasized by Him. And now
the same three are found here.</p>

<p>Dr. A.&nbsp;F. Schauffler tells of a striking experience
he had in connection with his mission work
in New York City. A letter came to him from
a stranger in Germany. It said: &quot;I know you
are a city missionary. I am sending a trunk in
your care. Inclosed in this letter you will find
a piece of paper cut. A man will come and present
to you a piece of paper matching this piece.
Please give him the trunk.&quot; And enclosed in
the letter was a piece of paper cut in zigzags.</p>

<p>Letter and paper were laid away to await developments.
Some weeks later a stranger came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Page 210]</a></span>
in and presented a queerly cut piece of paper,
saying: &quot;I think you have a piece that matches
this.&quot; Dr. Schauffler got out his piece of paper,
laid the two side by side, found that they
matched, and said to his visitor: &quot;There's your
trunk.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so these prophetic pages of the New
Testament are found to fit exactly the pages of
the Old, written centuries before. It is not surprising,
however. One hand cut the paper into
two pieces in Germany, and naturally they fitted
when put together in New York. One Hand has
guided the men writing in both Old and New.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[165] Jeremiah i. 11-12.</p></div><p>When Jeremiah was first called to his work
as God's messenger he was shown in vision the
branch of an almond tree. The almond tree is
the earliest of all trees to wake from its winter's
sleep at the first hint of spring warmth
coming. And so it was called the &quot;watching&quot;
or &quot;watcher&quot; tree. Then God said to Jeremiah:
&quot;Even so, I eagerly watch over my word to
bring it to life and fruitage at the very earliest
opportunity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><span class="snlabel">[165]</span> And so the word of this watching
God and its fulfilment match, regardless of
the thing we call time, even running into centuries.</p>

<p>And it is very helpful for those of us who have
had a sort of dread of prophecy as of a vague
something that we can't understand, to find after
all how simple it is. Just three great items stand
out of these prophetic pages that are waiting fulfilment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Page 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the seven-fold view, which is taken up
almost wholly with the clearing-up storm in the
King's realm. But all this is still future. We
are still in that waiting time. Our Lord Jesus
still stands among the candlesticks. Still He is
waiting for His Church to be faithful. He still
waits for each of us who is a bit of His Church.
He is depending on us to be faithful, by His
grace, day by day, during this waiting time. And
while He waits <i>all His limitless power is at our
disposal</i>, as we follow His leading. We may
take as much as we need. But the taking must
be with the life.</p>

<p>A dear missionary friend told of a simple experience
that meant much to him. We were
walking together in the town in Korea where
his mission work is. His school was the centre
of the recent troublous times in Korea, and
the storm seemed to rage about his own person
at its outburst. As we talked all his native
teachers and several of his older students were
in prison. The experience he told me was of
earlier days in this country, but had come back
to his memory as a great refreshment during
the troublous times.</p>

<p>He was a professor in a small college in our
Middle West. Special funds were being raised,
for extension. He was to ask a certain man
of wealth for a large donation. He planned
and prayed much, and at last went to see the
man in another city by appointment. He had
a keen sense of the responsibility of his
task.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Page 212]</a></span></p>

<p>As he entered the building where the man's
office was he was greeted cordially by a young
man whom he remembered as a former student,
to whom he had been friendly in some time of
minor need. But he had not connected him in
his mind with this wealthy man, whose son he
was. Now as the former student learned of his
professor friend's errand, he said with all the
confidence of a son on good terms with his
father:</p>

<p>&quot;Come right in; father's here.&quot;</p>

<p>As they stepped into the man's office the son
said, simply:</p>

<p>&quot;Father, this is an old friend of mine. He's
all right. Give him whatever he wants.&quot;</p>

<p>And the father, busy at his desk, with barely
a look at the appointed visitor, reached one
hand over for his checkbook, and simply
said:</p>

<p>&quot;How much do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>My friend, taken completely by surprise at
the unexpected turn of events, managed to name
the large sum he had been thinking and praying
over so much. And before he could quite recover
from his surprise, he found himself outside
walking up the street with the coveted check in
his pocket, praising God for such an answer to
his prayers. It had been years before, but as
we walked and talked it all came back with a
fresh flush of feeling.</p>

<p>The present is a waiting time. It may seem
to some as though they are in the wilderness.
Clear and distinct comes a quiet voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Page 213]</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;What'll you have? Whatever you choose to
ask, for My Son's sake.&quot;</p>

<p>May we reach out to take as much as He is
reaching down to give. But the taking must be
with the life.</p>

<h4>Day Is Coming.</h4>

<p>It's a long lane that has no turning. Every
valley leads up a hillside to a hilltop. Every
storm ends in sunshine at the last. Every night
runs out; the dawn <i>will</i> break; the new day
comes; the shadows flee before the new shining.
The battle for right will end in victory, and in a
decisive victory. There'll be no draw here.
Faith wins at last. It's been a long night of
fighting. Sometimes it seems endless.</p>

<p>The man in the thick of the fight, with moist
brow, and clenched hand, and quick breath and
throbbing heart, sometimes sobs out the prayer,
&quot;O Lord, how long before the night is over,
and the dawn breaks?&quot; And quietly through
the smoke and din of the conflict a still, small
voice says, &quot;Steady, my child, steady; the day
is surely coming, and with day victory; steady,
steady a bit longer.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[166] Habakkuk ii. 3.</p></div><p>Now here in vision the fight is over, the victory
won. And God's visions always become
realities. The vision is yet for the appointed
time, and it panteth breathlessly toward the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Page 218]</a></span>ization,
and will not fail nor delay. Though it
tarry, wait for it; it will certainly come on time;
it will not be late.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><span class="snlabel">[166]</span></p>

<p>In the seventh view the kingdom follows immediately
that decisive conflict and the putting
of Satan out of the way for the time being. The
redeemed ones at once begin their blessed service
of fellowship with the King in reigning over
the kingdom. Emphasis is placed on the fact
that at this time there has been a resurrection
of believers. And these resurrected ones join
with those caught up without death in administering
the kingdom. This kingdom is said to
last for a thousand years, that length of time
being named only here, and here six times.</p>

<p>There is much talk in our day about the kingdom.
All Christendom has been repeating for
nineteen centuries the petition, &quot;Thy kingdom
come.&quot; It will be of intense and practical interest
to see just what the kingdom is, as pictured
in the Bible. It is barely mentioned in
this place in Revelation, to fit it into its place in
the scheme of future events being outlined.</p>

<p>But it is the chief theme in these old prophetic
pages, around which all others group. Immediate
historical events furnish the setting, but
there is a continual swinging to the coming
future greatness. The yellow glory-light of the
coming kingdom is never out of the prophetic
sky. Jeremiah is the one most absorbed in the
boiling of the political pot of his own strenuous
time, but even he, at times, lifts his head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Page 219]</a></span>
gets such a glimpse of the coming kingdom
as causes him to mix some rose tincture with
the jet black ink he habitually uses.</p>

<h4>The Kingdom Picture.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[167] Acts ii. 44-47; iv. 32-34.</p></div><p>Let us look briefly at the kingdom picture of
these older pages. Its capital is Jerusalem,
which becomes the world capital. It will be the
joy of the whole earth. Israel will be the first
nation of the earth, to which all others will be
tributary. But it will be not the Israel of these
old pages, nor the Jew as he is known characteristically
throughout history. Israel will be a
new nation, made new in character by the power
of the Holy Spirit. The winsome picture of the
baptized crowds at Pentecost gives an inkling of
the spirit that will sway the new nation.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><span class="snlabel">[167]</span> They
will be a nation of radiant faces and thrilled
hearts.</p>

<p>The effect of this upon all other nations is
marked. Through Israel's regeneration and new
leadership, every other nation is to know a new
spirit life. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit
upon Israel is to be followed by an outpouring
upon <i>all</i> flesh. Pentecost is merely a beginning
of what is to be universal. There will be a
widespread voluntary coming to Israel for religious
instruction. She becomes the world's
teacher until the knowledge of God covers the
whole earth as the waters cover the sea. But
all this will be purely a voluntary movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Page 220]</a></span>
among the nations. There will be war no longer,
but universal peace.</p>

<p>There's one part of the picture specially comforting.
That vast majority, <i>the poor</i>, will be
specially guarded and cared for. There will be
no hungry people, nor cold, nor poorly clad; no
unemployed begging for a chance to earn a dry
crust, and no workers fighting for a fair share
of the fruit of their toil. But there are yet
tenderer touches on the canvas. Broken hearts
will be healed, prison doors unhung, broken
family circles complete again.</p>

<p>A recent issue of The Sunday School Times
tells a simple, touching incident of a mission
hall in Korea. A Korean woman living in the
country heard of the wonderful things happening
there, and came to town to find out for herself,
and get some help. But she didn't know
where the hall was, nor what name it was called.
So she inquired on the streets for the place where
they <i>cured the broken heart</i>. And at once she
was directed to the mission hall. That sort of
thing will become a blessed commonplace in the
beginning of the kingdom time.</p>

<p>Then there are certain radical changes in
<i>nature</i>. Splendid rivers of waters are to flow
through or by Jerusalem, suggesting radical
changes in the formation of the land there. That
fortress city, on the hilltop, Jerusalem, becomes
as the world's metropolis, a mighty city, with
rivers floating a world's commerce. The light
of sun and moon will be greatly intensified, so
influencing the fertility of the earth. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Page 221]</a></span>
their healing light and heat, in the newly tempered
atmosphere, all poisonous growths, the
blight of drought, and suffering of untempered
heat, will disappear.</p>

<p>And with this goes a change in the <i>animal</i>
creation. Hate will be gone. And so beasts
that are dreaded because of their ferocity and
treachery and poisonous power will be wholly
changed. There will be mutual cessation of
cruelty to animals by man, and of danger to
man by animals, for all hate and violence will
be gone.</p>

<p>And some one raises his eyebrows sceptically
and says, ironically, &quot;What fairy tale, what
skipper's yarn, is this?&quot; Well, I frankly confess
that I don't know anything about this matter,
except what I find in this old Book of God.
But I confess, too, that I try studiously to get
a common-sense, poised, Spirit-enlightened understanding
of what this Book does tell. And
then I accept it, and go by it, regardless of probabilities
or improbabilities. It may seem like a
fairy tale, yet it is only the picture of the
coming kingdom soberly set forth in these old
pages.</p>

<p>As we turn to the Gospel pages we find the
kingdom to be the chief thing Jesus is talking
about. The Gospel days are sample days of the
kingdom in the personal blessings bestowed.
Read through these accounts of blind eyes
opened, the lame walking, the maimed made
whole, the dumb singing, the distressed in whatever
way relieved, the ignorant instructed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Page 222]</a></span>
sinful wooed, and the bad of heart and life being
blessedly changed.</p>

<p>All this is a taste of the kingdom. Jesus was
wooing men to accept King and kingdom. To-day,
as in all Church time, bodily healing is a
privilege for those who can take it, and a gift
for the rare few who can be entrusted with it.
In these Gospel pages it was freely bestowed on
multitudes, and the gift exercised with power by
many. Even so it will be in the kingdom time.</p>

But in their hearts many will long for something

<div class="sidenote"><p>[173] Matthew xiii. 44.</p><p>[174] Matthew xiii. 45-46.</p></div><p>But to many, the new blessed kingdom message

as <i>the</i> thing they have been eagerly seeking for,

who has had any touch with the pathetic yearning
of years found in non-Christian lands can
better appreciate the results of this kind in these
glad coming days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[175] Matthew xxi. 31.</p></div><p>The <i>characteristic spirit</i> of the kingdom
stands sharply out in contrast with the dominant
spirit of our own time. The kingdom is said to
belong peculiarly to those who are &quot;poor in
spirit,&quot; in whom self-assertion and pride have
quite gone out, leaving them humble and lowly
in heart. The meek will inherit the earth, and
will take down all the walls and fences, for all
conditions of life are radically changed. The
penitent man or woman will be freely received
regardless of their past, while the proud will
find the doorway too low for their unbending
heads.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><span class="snlabel">[175]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[176] Matthew xx. 1-16.</p><p>[177] Luke xix. 11-27.</p><p>[178] Matthew xx. 25-28.</p></div><p>Rewards in the kingdom will not be given as a
matter of merit, as in our present endless cutting
and rivalry, but will be thought of wholly
as evidence of the graciousness of the King.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><span class="snlabel">[176]</span>
And yet more striking, the rewards given will
be the privilege of serving, some more, some less,
according as they have become skilled in serving.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><span class="snlabel">[177]</span>
He who serves most truly will be given
preferment.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><span class="snlabel">[178]</span> The thing prized above all else
will be glad obedience to the King.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the kingdom is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Page 224]</a></span>
a time of world-wide evangelization. Indeed
this is <i>the purpose</i> of the kingdom. There are
two periods of world-wide evangelization in our
Lord's planning. The present is the Church
time of such evangelizing. This is, of course,
the true main objective of the Church. This is
the reason for the Church's existence, to take the
message of a crucified risen Christ to all men,
that so the way may be prepared for His return,
and through that for the next period of evangelizing.</p>

<p>The kingdom period of world-wide evangelization
is under radically different conditions.
Then the evil one will be removed from the
scene of action, the Holy Spirit will have been
poured out upon all flesh, and so the moral veil
now upon men's eyes will be removed. The
Jews, with all their characteristic aggressiveness
and perseverance, now intensified by the Holy
Spirit's presence, will be a nation of missionaries
to all the earth. The redeemed ones in their
resurrection bodies will have the blessed privilege
of helping. And over all will be the presence
and supervision of the King, our Lord Jesus
Himself. That will be world-wide evangelization
in earnest.</p>

<p>Such is a faint glimpse given in both Old and
New Testaments of the kingdom spoken of in
these Revelation pages in such few words. Almost
the whole Bible lies back of those few
words. What a time it will be for this old earth!
With renewed fervour our hearts repeat, &quot;Thy
kingdom come.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Page 225]</a></span></p>

<h4>The Final Crisis of Choice.</h4>

<p>But it is made clear at once to John that the
kingdom is not an end in itself. It is a means
to an end, a wonderful means to a blessed end.
It is startling to find that after that long blessed
reign the evil one is to be loosed out of his prison-abyss.
This seems at first flush too startling to
be credible. But on reflection the reason becomes
plain, and reveals the strength as well as the
tenderness of God's love.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[179] Psalm xviii. 44; lxvi. 3; lxxxi. 15; note marginal
readings.</p><p>[180] Matthew xiii. 47-50.</p><p>[181] Matthew xiii. 24-30, 36-43.</p></div><p>All through the kingdom time there are those
who are in heart opposed to this new order of
things. They long for the leeks and onions and
garlic of the old eating. There will be some
yielding only a feigned allegiance to the King.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><span class="snlabel">[179]</span>
That dragnet of the parable has gathered some
fish that didn't want to be caught, and want a
chance to get away to their own native waters
again.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><span class="snlabel">[180]</span> The tares of another parable are left
in with the wheat until the end reveals which
is real wheat and which really tares.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><span class="snlabel">[181]</span></p>

<p>The one thing God longs for is love. And
that only is love which is the free outpouring
of the heart. He longs for love as our free
choice. This is the image of God in which we
have all been made. We are most like God in
<i>power</i>, in the right of free choice. We are most
like Him in <i>character</i> when we use our power
as He uses His; when we choose what He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Page 226]</a></span>
chooses for us. And so there must be a final
time of sifting and choosing.</p>

<p>Here is the strength of love, that dares loose
Satan out that so we must choose in the face of
opposition. For faith isn't faith except it can
stand the fire test, the friction fire test of opposition.
Here is the tenderness of love, that longs
to have a return love as pure and free as its own,
and so gives fullest opportunity for it to be revealed
and to grow.</p>

<p>So Satan is loosed out for his tempting work.
And another great world crisis comes, and another
great settlement; this the final one. The
devil, his beastly Antichrist and false prophet,
are put out of the way forever.</p>

<p>A great dazzling throne is set. And One sits
on it with a face of indescribable glory. Then
comes the second resurrection, of all those not
included in the first resurrection a thousand years
before. This is a judgment of <i>all who have died</i>,
with the exception already noted. The judgment
of the living spoken of in Matthew, twenty-five,
probably is in connection with the closing
scene of the great crisis, just before this judgment
of the resurrected dead, or possibly in connection
with this judgment. This is the final
judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[182] Revelation xx. 15.</p></div><p>Gladness and distress mingle in reading the
account: gladness that the contest, age long, is
over; distress to find that for some there is what
is described briefly but with terrible intensity,
in the words, &quot;the lake of fire.&quot; Yet there is
still comfort in noting the language used of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Page 227]</a></span>
these,&mdash;&quot;<i>if any</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><span class="snlabel">[182]</span> It is not the language of a
great multitude, but rather of an incorrigible
scattered and scant minority.</p>

<h4>Home at Last.</h4>

<p>And now for the seventh time in this last
vision John says, &quot;I saw.&quot; Bit by bit the view
opens up before his eyes, from the coming of the
Lord Jesus out of the opened heavens, on and
on, until now the final view of all bursts in a
winsome glory before his astonished, delighted
eyes.</p>

<p>God's own ideal, that He has been carrying
in His heart, is pictured. That ideal is that He
and man shall dwell together as a family. The
ideal is not a Church nor a Kingdom. These
are merely great means to a greater end.
The ideal is the family, all dwelling together
in sweetest harmony and content, with a
common board, and a common fireside in the
twilight of the day, and all the sweet fellowship
that these stand for.</p>

<p>John sees a new heaven and a new earth, the
old heaven and earth gone, and with them the
separation of the wide sea gone forever, too.
He sees the holy city, Jerusalem, made over new,
coming down out of the new heavens to man's
new dwelling-place, the new earth. It presents a
wondrous, joyous appearance as of a bride
adorned for her husband.</p>

<p>Then a great voice out of the throne speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Page 228]</a></span>
of this ideal in the heart of God for Himself and
His friend, man. &quot;Look! God has pitched His
tent down amongst men, and they shall be His
peoples, and He will be their God.&quot; He will
live with them as a Father-mother-God, personally
caring for each one, Himself wiping away
every tear from every eye. A single tear and a
single pair of eyes will be enough to claim His
personal attention at once.</p>

<p>His presence insures the absence forever of
death, and mourning, and pain, and crying. The
dirge music has sung its last song. The minor
chords are gone. All the old things of a sorrowful
sort are quite gone. And as John looks
He that sitteth on the throne makes the glad
announcement, &quot;<i>Behold, I make all things new.</i>&quot;
And John is bidden to write all this, for &quot;<i>these
words are faithful and true</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>And again the One on the throne seems to
look eagerly forward to His ideal as already
actually accomplished: &quot;They are come to
pass.&quot; And to let John feel the certainty of it
all He says, &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end.&quot; The power that
has done all from creation's morn will complete
all clear to the end.</p>

<p>And then the tenderness of that highest love
which finds expression in the personal touch
comes out in the next words: &quot;I will give unto
him that is athirst of the fountain of life freely.&quot;
The smallest need of any one will have His personal
thought and attention, and they shall have
the best there is, and have it in abundance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Page 229]</a></span></p>

<p>And the old pleading that runs like a strain
of music throughout these pages comes again:
&quot;He that <i>overcometh</i> shall inherit these things.
I will be His God, and he shall be my son,&quot; and
so entitled to the inheritance.</p>

<p>Then plainly, clearly, with all the honesty of
love, comes the warning of the terrible outcome
for those who refuse His tender love. It is most
significant that this most winsome picture at the
end of the book contains the dark, black shadows,
which remain in the picture at the end.</p>

<p>All this is spoken directly to John by God
Himself. It is not sent by an angel, or by a
redeemed human messenger. It comes to John
direct with all the force and tenderness of a
word spoken to him out of the very heart of God.</p>

<p>And now an angel carries John off to let him
see this that is called both a bride and a city.
And from the top of a high mountain John looks
out and sees a most wonderful city, coming down
out of heaven from God, filled and flooded with
the glory of God.</p>

<p>And the best language that earth knows anything
about is used in the attempt to describe
this city ideal. Its dimensions are perfect in
proportion and in their outer relations. Its
foundations are adorned with the costliest, most
precious stones, the walls are built of jasper,
and each gate is one immense pearl; but the city
itself is builded of a gold as transparent as pure
glass. Israel and the Church are as sweet memories
of past days, recalled now by gates and
foundations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Page 230]</a></span></p>

<p>But these are passed by in noting the outshining
glory of the presence of God. In the simple
language which has become so imbedded in the
heart and imagination of the Church, &quot;the
city hath no need of the sun, neither of the
moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God did
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.&quot;
And the winsome description goes on. The nations
walk in this wondrous light of God's presence,
and the kings of earth bring glad tribute
of their glory into it. &quot;And the gates thereof
shall in no wise be shut by day, for there shall
be no night there.&quot; &quot;And there shall in no wise
enter into it anything unclean, or he that doeth
an abomination and a lie, but only they that are
written in the Lamb's book of life.&quot;</p>

<p>In the midst of the city is a river of water of
life clear as sparkling crystal, flowing out from
the throne of God and of the Lamb. On each
side of the river is the tree of life yielding continual
fruitage. And the leaves of the tree were
for the healing of the nations.</p>

<p>And the heart never fails to respond with a
quickened beat to the lines: &quot;His servants shall
serve Him; and <i>they shall see His face</i>; and His
name shall be in their foreheads;&quot;&mdash;that is, His
character shall shine out of their faces. &quot;And
there shall be no night there; and they need no
candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord
God giveth them light. And they shall reign
forever and ever.&quot;</p>

<p>Such is the heart-touching, heart-gripping tale
of God's ideal for man, His creature and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Page 231]</a></span>panion
and friend. All the best that the city
stands for of human life, and all the best that the
country, typified in the garden, stands for, are
forever blessedly joined. And in the midst&mdash;<i>Himself</i>,
and gathered about Him His redeemed
ones, as children about a father, in a union and
fellowship cemented by the heart's blood of God,
never more to be put asunder.</p>

<h4>The Master's Last Words.</h4>

<p>And John closes the book with a few personal
paragraphs. The vision is complete. Now come
the closing words. For the third time John is
solemnly assured, &quot;these words are faithful and
true.&quot; And again comes the voice as of some
One always standing by as John is being shown,
&quot;Behold, I come quickly.&quot; And again the words
with which the book begins come to seal all its
impressions,&mdash;blessed is he that reads, and prayerfully
seeks to understand the simple message,
and who sets himself to live his life in the light
of this simple tremendous message.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[183] Daniel xii. 4, 9.</p></div><p>And John is significantly told <i>not</i> to <i>seal up</i> the
message. Daniel had been told to seal up the
message given him, for it would not come to pass
until the latter days after great intervening
events had taken place.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><span class="snlabel">[183]</span> But there are no intervening
events before this message is to come true.
It has been possible for the fulfilment to come in
any generation since John saw and wrote. It is
yet more possible, growing distinctly toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Page 232]</a></span>
probable, that these things shall come in our
generation. The words remain open, waiting
an expectant fulfilment. They are not to be
sealed up but openly proclaimed, for the time
when it is possible for these things to work out
is at hand. This is a present practical issue.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, during these days of the waiting
time each one who reads or listens, however
reluctantly, to the message, will follow the bent
of his own deliberate choice, but with ever increasing
intensity. The pure will become more
pure; the bad yet worse. There's no standing
still as we listen.</p>

<p>And again come the solemnly repeated words:
&quot;Behold, I come quickly.&quot; His coming is the
next step in the great plan. There were then,
and there are now, no great intervening events
to be worked out, and waited for. His coming
is imminent. It is a thing to be expected.
And He brings with Him the wages due each
one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[184] Revelation i. 8.</p></div><p>And like the signature of certification at the
book's beginning,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><span class="snlabel">[184]</span> comes now the personal signature
at its close: &quot;I am the Alpha and the
Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and
the end.&quot; So He personally certifies to us the
absolute accuracy and reliability of this message.</p>

<p>And with the signature come again the
gracious pleading and warning intermingled.
Any one who will may wash his robes in the
fountain provided, and may eat of the life-giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Page 233]</a></span>
tree, and come unto the God-lit city. And
equally clear it is that any who insist on doing
so may remain outside unwashed. Each one is
free to do as he wills.</p>

<p>And once again comes the emphatic, solemn
announcement of the accuracy and dependability
of this message of John's Revelation: &quot;<i>I, Jesus</i>,
have sent mine angel to testify unto you these
things for the Churches.&quot; It is distinctively a
Church message, and comes with all the direct
authority of our Lord Jesus Himself. And He
patiently reminds us of His authority,&mdash;I am
both root and offspring of David, both before
him and after him. I am the bright, the morning
star, that rises while it is yet night and brings
in the new day.</p>

<p>And again the spirit of winsome pleading
breaks out to those unwashed ones who insist on
staying outside the gate. Both the Spirit and
the whole company of washed ones say &quot;come.&quot;
And let him that heareth that sweet word pass
it out to those farther away until the last man
hears and feels. And let them know that anybody
at all who is thirsty may come freely and
drink of the river of the water of life.</p>

<p>And yet once again comes the peculiar certifying
of the contents of this Revelation message,
and a solemn warning against any interfering
with its meaning. Jesus says,&mdash;I hereby certify
unto every man that hears the words of the
prophecy of this book: if any man add to them,
making them mean something else than I intend,
God shall add unto him the plagues that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Page 234]</a></span>
are written in this book: and if any man shall
take away, or lessen the meaning, God shall
take away his part from the tree of life and out
of the holy city. It comes as a very solemn
warning.</p>

<p>And yet once more comes the emphatic assurance
both of the reliability of the book itself,
and of the certainty of its great central message,&mdash;&quot;He
who testifieth these things saith, '<i>yea, I
come quickly</i>.'&quot;</p>

<p>And John fervently adds, &quot;Amen; come, Lord
Jesus.&quot; And so says every heart in tune with
His heart who is coming.</p>

<h4>The Thrill of Expectancy.</h4>

<p>Watching reveals character and makes it. It
means wakefulness, an ideal, a purpose, and a
hopeful expectancy. Some people only look.
Their eyelids are not shut. Something passes
before the eye. They look, but they rarely see.</p>

<p>It takes a soul to see. It needs a spirit awake
to see out through the eye, and see into persons
and events passing by, and see forward to what
is coming to-morrow. Some sleep. The body
is awake in daytime. They walk and talk and
eat, buy and sell, count money and hoard it.
But their eyes are never lifted to the outer
horizon. They are settled in an even, contented
round. Their spirits sleep.</p>

<p>A wakefulness of spirit to the time and its
need, an ideal clear and high of what should be,
a purpose strong and masterful that holds the
life up toward the ideal, an expectancy eager,
brave, steady; an eye fixed intently on some One
unseen,&mdash;this is what watching means. It reveals
character. It makes character. It reaches
out strong spirit hands, and brings nearer and
sooner the thing watched for.</p>

<p>Watching has always been a characteristic of
the men God has used. He used them because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Page 238]</a></span>
He could. They were of use. Their spirit made
them serviceable. Their watching opened the
way for fellowship of spirit and partnership in
action. It put them in tune with Him who never
slumbers nor sleeps, and who watches over His
pledged word, to bring it to pass at the earliest
possible hour.</p>

<p>The watcher sings. His favourite song is &quot;I
will lift up mine eyes.&quot; He sees what is coming.
He sees <i>Him</i> who sits beyond the horizon of our
common outlook. And seeing Him grows this
sort of expectancy, and the expectancy becomes
the controlling thing.</p>

<p>It was this sort of expectancy that made Abraham
a pilgrim at seventy-five, and that grew
deep the pilgrim trait of patient endurance
through the weary twilight years till the promised
heir came, and even beyond that, wove the finest
texture into his character when the severest test
came.</p>

<p>It was this expectancy that drew Moses away
from the court life of Egypt, and the possible
prospect of wearing imperial purple, to become
the leader of a straggling crowd of slaves. And
it held him steady on through long years, wilderness
travel, criticism, and non-appreciation, on
and on, till Nebo's top was climbed. He endured
as seeing Him who was invisible to the
unseeing eyes of the crowds at His side.</p>

<p>Such expectancy has steadied every leader for
God, in these old pages from first to last, young
Joseph in the dungeon, Joshua in the glare of the
limelight, into which he was suddenly thrust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Page 239]</a></span>
and ruddy-faced singing David fleeing and hiding
for his life from the javelin of Saul. It was
the clear-seeing eye of Isaiah and Jeremiah in
the homeland, and of Ezekiel and Daniel among
the weeping exiles, that kept the heart of the
nation warm with the vision of what was surely
coming. The thrill of expectancy runs through
the pages of this old Hebrew classic. Its light is
never out of the eye, nor its alluring out of earshot.</p>

<p>When Jesus walked among men expectation
ran high. When He was killed the gloom of the
three days was the gloom of a bright light suddenly
put out. The darkness was intensified
by the light that had been shining. Then there
came a new sort of expectancy, higher, finer, of
the inner spirit. This Jesus was coming back,
in all the glory of the old prophetic vision, made
realer by the personal touch these men knew,
and this new expectancy puts all the paper of the
New Testament a-tremble with delight. It is
the light that lighteth every page and epistle,
every contested path of witness, and every hour
of suffering because of faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[185] Acts iii. 20-21; xv. 14-18.</p></div><p>The Church of these New Testament pages is
<i>a watching Church</i>. The expectancy of the
Lord Jesus' return is the north star of their sky.
It never swerves. All the rest revolves around
it. They see everything else in relation to this.
Their going into all the world and preaching to
every creature was not simply for men's conversion:
that surely: but beyond that, it was to
bring the Christ back for the next step in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Page 240]</a></span>
world programme. He would come and set up
His kingdom, and then through the kingdom
would come a yet wider, farther-reaching world
evangelizing.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><span class="snlabel">[185]</span> This expectancy controlled their
life and activity. Through their faithful world
witnessing He would come.</p>

<p>And as the knot is put on the end of the
thread of revelation the very knotted thread
seems aglow with the glory of what is coming.
The Bible from end to end is a-thrill with expectancy,
a hopeful watching for something, aye,
<i>for some One</i>.</p>

<h4>A Calendar of Events.</h4>

<p>We have been looking a bit closely at this
knot in the end, the threads composing it. Now
we want to gather up all that we have been going
over with the light that comes from the other
pages, so as to have some sort of a simple, clear
grasp of the truth. This will help our eyesight.
We can watch the horizon better. Our eyes
will be steadier in the glare of the lower lights,
and sharper to see in the spells of darkness that
get thicker now and then.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that this book of the
Revelation is a calendar book. That is to say,
it is not a calendar of dates but of events. It
gives coming events in the order in which they
will occur. Its table of contents becomes an
outline of coming events. There is the Man
of Fire standing among the candlesticks. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Page 241]</a></span>
comes an hour when He advances to the next
step in His programme. Then, step by step,
there follow the occurrences until the kingdom is
actually here. And then the after events, when
the kingdom's work is done.</p>

<p>It turns out that this thing of our Lord's return
cuts a wider swath than we are apt to
think, if we don't stop to think. That is because
of <i>Who it is</i> that is coming. An event takes
on the size of the chief person concerned. This
Lord Jesus is the One through whom our
world was made in the early time, when there
were no calendars. So His coming naturally
concerns the whole world. It concerns the system
of evil in which the world is entangled, and
the evil spirit world so closely interlocked with
our own.</p>

<p>Then our Lord Jesus came amongst us as a
man. He came as a Jewish man, and to the
Jewish nation. So His coming concerns the
Jew and the Jewish capital, Jerusalem. When
He sent down His executive, the Holy Spirit, a
new organization was formed, the Church. So
His coming concerns the Church, and concerns
it very intimately, for it is spoken of as a body
of which He is the head. When Jesus came it
was to die for a world and to redeem a world.
And so His coming concerns the future plans of
the earth and the race.</p>

<p>Yet though His coming has such a broad
sweep, it is quite possible to get a grasp of the
few essential items in the programme. And this
will make our footing steadier, our vision clearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Page 242]</a></span>
our praying more confident, and our soul-winning
and witnessing warmer and truer. We turn
now to try to get this simple, helpful understanding.</p>

<p>The present is the time of the candlesticks.
The Man of Fire is in our midst unperceived.
The unseen Eyes of Flame see. Our Lord Jesus
still waits, and depends on the faithfulness of
His Church. The light is still shining out. The
dark places are getting some light. The light
has not yet wholly failed to get out through the
human lantern to the crowd in the dark.</p>

<p>The characteristics of this waiting time, so
long prolonged, are plainly put. In the outer
world there will be an increasing lawlessness
and disregard of every sort of restraint, and an
increasing power of organization and centralization.
There will be an increasing getting together
for more effective action.</p>

<p>In the Church world there will be an increasing
formalism, a compromise with evil and
with the world spirit. There will be a decrease
of warm personal devotion to the Lord Jesus
as the controlling motive power. And there will
be a growing inclination to make light of, or
ignore, or jeer at, the idea of the Lord Jesus'
return.</p>

<p>As this period wears on toward its close, and
so on toward the events to follow, there will be
a coming together of the Jews scattered throughout
the world in an attempt to regain Palestine
and reconstitute the Hebrew nation there with
its temple and old sacrificial ritual. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Page 243]</a></span>
are the three chief tendencies that will characterize
the present waiting time preceding the
group of coming events.</p>

<p>The decisive index-finger, that this present
period is actually coming to its close, will be this
movement among the Jews. The movement to
regain control of Palestine may rise and fall
back, gain and lose again. But some day it will
come to its head. By some arrangement with
the nations concerned the Jewish nation will
actually be set up again in Palestine, and the
building of the temple in Jerusalem begun. This
will be the decisive indication. This is an unfailing
index-finger. The hands of the clock
are moving then toward the striking of the hour.
Soon the sands will be run out and the hour-glass
turned.</p>

<h4>The Beginning of the End.</h4>

<p>At some time soon after that point is reached
<i>two unseen events will occur</i>, that is, unseen on
earth. Roughly, it will be three and a half years
after, though the whole tendency of the Scripture
is to discourage the figuring of <i>exact</i> time.
Yet information is given that the outlook may be
intelligent. These events are unseen on the
earth. They take place in heaven.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit will be withdrawn from the
Church. He will not be withdrawn from individuals.
He abode in men before the Church
was formed, and will after the Church has cast
Him out. He is withdrawn only because He has
been practically and wholly cast out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Page 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lord Jesus, who sent Him down to form
the Church and witness through it, will withdraw
Him from the Church. The candlestick
has moved out of all touch with the light. And
now the light is withdrawn, and so the candlestick
moved out of its place as the light-bearer.
This is probably the advance step taken by our
Lord Jesus that marks the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>At the same time there occurs a conflict of
spirit forces up in the heavens. While the earth
seems to be Satan's chief place of activity, yet his
headquarters are up in the heavens, that is,
somewhere below the throne of God and above
the earth. This conflict is against him and his
spirit forces. It is led by Michael, the archangel.
It results in Satan and his host being cast
out of the heavens and down to the earth.</p>

<p>It is significant that as the Holy Spirit goes
up, this conflict follows, and Satan is cast out
and down. Is it the Holy Spirit's return there
that precipitates this conflict, and defeat for
Satan? It would seem not improbable. So the
moral situation on the earth is intensified doubly.
The blessed Holy Spirit, with all His power of
restraint over evil, is withdrawn. The evil spirit,
with all his power of intensifying evil, is cast
down in person to the earth. These are the two
unseen events marking the advance move of the
end time.</p>

<p>There will be nothing on earth <i>at the moment</i>
to indicate that these tremendous events have
happened. There is no suggestion of how much
time is involved. Time is a matter of earth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Page 245]</a></span>
calculation. Quite possibly <i>we</i> would speak of
these events as occurring in a very brief time,
perhaps an instant of our reckoning. These are
the two events unseen on the earth.</p>

<p>At the same time there will begin <i>two events
seen taking place on earth</i>. The first is the coming
to the front of a man, a terrible leader of
the forces of unrighteousness. Paul speaks of
him as &quot;the Lawless One.&quot; John's name for
him is &quot;the Antichrist.&quot; He becomes the human
representative or incarnation of Satan. As
Satan is cast down out of the heavens this
leader comes to the front on earth.</p>

<p>He seems to have official position at the head
of some great coalition of nations, with a wide
area of authority. He seems to be some former
notable leader known in history, who died, but
is now brought back to life again by Satan's
supernatural power.</p>

<p>As he forges to the front there follows on
earth a horrible time of war, famine, pestilence,
death, and persecution. He arbitrarily breaks
the agreement with the Jews under which they
have re-established their nation, and begins a
terrible persecution of them. He sets up in the
temple a blasphemous image, and requires that
all people shall worship it. This strikes not
only at the Jew, but at the Christian as well.</p>

<p>At one stroke of genius he compels absolutely
universal attention to his command by forbidding
the doing of any business except by those willing
to worship the image. Those refusing the worship
are killed. He will have an assistant doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Page 246]</a></span>
wonderful miracles by Satanic power to deceive
and persuade the people. During this time there
is a loosing out on the earth of countless hordes
of unseen demons to torment men.</p>

<p>All this continues for three and a half years.
The time is stated in three different ways to
make quite clear just how long is meant. This
is the first of the two seen events. It centres
at Jerusalem and seems to reach out practically
to all the earth.</p>

<p>The second event is significant. During all
this terrible time of persecution and blasphemy
and the riot of evil, there will be two men in
Jerusalem preaching the Gospel of the Lord
Jesus, and calling on men to repent. As an
emphasis of their witness against the awful
wickedness current they will be clothed in
mourning. They will have miraculous power to
attest their witness, and to protect themselves
against attacks upon their lives. The great
crowds of many nationalities in Jerusalem will
make their witness practically world-wide in its
direct as well as its indirect influence.</p>

<p>This also continues for three and a half years.
As the Holy Spirit is withdrawn from the
Church as the witness of the Lord Jesus, these
two special witnesses appear. In His great
faithfulness and patience God never leaves Himself
without a witness. This is the second event
seen on earth. These two, evil at its worst, and
God's special witnesses, run along side by side,
both centring in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Page 247]</a></span></p>

<h4>The Climax&mdash;He Comes.</h4>

<p>Then there comes <i>a group of four events</i>.
And these four are very closely associated together
in point of time. They occur at the close
of the period of persecution and wickedness. Indeed,
it is their occurrence that brings the close.
Yet the exact time when they happen is left
quite uncertain.</p>

<p>And this clearly is another bit of the tendency
in the record to keep our thought on the main
events, and not on figuring out time. We are
to keep to the essentials and be wary of mere
speculation. For the sake of clearness I am putting
these four events separately, but this does
not mean that some of them may not be occurring
at the same moment, or that all may not
come within a very brief time. We simply do
not know. It looks as though we are not meant
to know.</p>

<p>There is <i>a Jew event</i>. The Holy Spirit comes
down upon the nation of Jews in simple, tremendous,
converting power. This is put in connection
with the coming down out of the heavens
on a cloud of the Lord Jesus. It seems to be
this sight of their great Kinsman, Jesus, whom
they crucified, that is used by the Holy Spirit
to strike penitence to their stubborn hearts. Literally
a nation is born again in a day. It will
be with the whole nation as it was with Saul
on the Damascus road, as sudden and unexpected,
as startling and as radical; as sudden and
unexpected an appearance of Jesus, as startling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Page 248]</a></span>
to the Jews, as radical in the absolute spirit
transformation.</p>

<p>There is <i>a Church event</i>. And here the word
Church is used to describe all believers in the
Lord Jesus. That will be a much sifted and
chastened company of people. This event is
also connected with the open, visible coming of
the Lord Jesus, out of the upper blue, before all
eyes. It affects two separate companies of believers.
The bodies of all believers who have
died will be raised out of their graves, inhabited
again by those who lived in them. Then
the living believers shall have a transforming
touch upon their bodies. And the two companies
shall be caught up into the air into the presence
of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>As they come into His presence there will
be a purifying and perfecting of character, and
an adjustment of relations with Him. There
is no suggestion of how much time is involved.
We naturally think of things as taking place
through so much time. Our limitations in this
regard will be gone then. It may be what we
now call instantaneous.</p>

<p>There is <i>a world event</i>. There will come to
the earth and to men a visitation of terrible judgments,
affecting men's bodies, the sea and rivers,
vegetation, an intensifying of the sun's heat, and
possibly a terrible darkness&mdash;in short, affecting
everything concerning man and life on the earth.
There will be a great gathering of the armies of
the nations at a place in Palestine. Again there
is no suggestion of how much time this visita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Page 249]</a></span>tion
of judgments runs through, nor this gathering
for battle.</p>

<p>Then there is <i>the</i> event, <i>the great climax event</i>,
the actual coming of the Lord Jesus, out of the
heavens, down to the earth. At the moment
when He comes the Jews will be in the midst
of a terrible siege in Jerusalem. Against the
city will be assembled the armies of the nations.
The city will be taken, the looting and ravaging
already begun.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, out of the blue above, the
Lord Jesus comes in a great blaze of blinding
light, accompanied by great numbers. He will
come to Olivet. With the coming will be a terrible
earthquake, such as the earth has never
known.</p>

<p>It is a striking geological fact that the greatest
&quot;fault,&quot; or break in the earth's surface, is
found in Palestine, running north and south from
Antioch on the Orontes down even into Africa.
But this earthquake will affect very wide areas,
including the city of Babylon, which will be
shaken to utter destruction. That earthquake
will make radical changes in the formation of
the earth's surface in Palestine.</p>

<p>At the same time there will be an equally terrific
shake-up in the heavenly bodies, the sun,
moon, and stars. The effect of both these upon
the vast panic-stricken multitudes will be most
pitiable. They will call upon the upheaved rocks
to hide them from the wrath of God.</p>

<p>These are the four events occurring at this
time. They are grouped together. It seems im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Page 250]</a></span>possible
to say first this, then that. They are
grouped. The great essential thing standing out
is that our Lord Jesus' coming will be at a terrible
climax of evil. There will be partial judgment
visited on the earth. The system of evil
will be wholly overthrown. The Jews will be
converted as a nation by the Holy Spirit. The
Church will be caught away out of the distress,
and will have part with our Lord Jesus in His
coming.</p>

<p>It should again be noticed that in all this there
are no time notes, except as to the length of this
tribulation time. The persecution of the Jew
and desecration of Jerusalem, the time of the
two witnesses, and the sway of the Antichrist,
each runs through three and a half years. There
are no time notes whatever for the present
waiting-time. And though the length of the
tribulation itself is stated, yet it should be noted
that the exact time of the Lord Jesus' actual
return still remains quite undetermined.</p>

<p>In Daniel's prophecy there are four events
spoken of as occurring at this time, and each
is measured from the time when the sacrifices
are stopped and the chief desecrating act in the
temple begins. The tribulation runs for three
and a half years. Thirty days later comes some
glad event not specified further. Seventy-five
days later there comes another glad event, and
two years ten months and twenty days later the
complete cleansing of the temple. Each of these
portions of time is measured from the same
starting point. This would suggest a period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Page 251]</a></span>
readjustment after the Antichrist is slain, running
through almost three years. All these
time notes are of a year of three hundred and
sixty days, not our common calendar year of
three hundred and sixty-five and a fraction
days.</p>

<p>There comes the period called the kingdom.
Its capital is Jerusalem. The regenerated nation
of Israel becomes the first nation of the earth,
with all other nations tributary. Israel's leadership
is a blessed one in its spiritual influence over
all others. The Jews are a missionary nation,
whose one passion is to make the knowledge of
God known throughout the earth.</p>

<p>The redeemed ones of all the earth through
all times will reign <i>over</i> the earth in fellowship
with the King, the Lord Jesus. In their resurrection
bodies, with all present bodily restrictions
and limitations gone, they will have a
blessed share in the new earth ministry.</p>

<p>The purpose of the kingdom is world-wide
evangelization, but with all the conditions radically
changed. Satan, with all evil spirits, is
removed from the scene of action. The nation
of Jews, baptized by the Holy Spirit, is the
missionary force, under the direction and help
of the Church. The Holy Spirit will have been
poured out upon all flesh, making all peculiarly
open to the truth.</p>

<p>What a wonderful time of continual revival it
will be! But that much abused word &quot;revival&quot;
will have its sweet, original meaning restored.
It will mean a re-living, a new life of the Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Page 252]</a></span>
coming, that will naturally include the body,
too.</p>

<h4>Intelligent Watching.</h4>

<p>Such are the events, near and far, which some
day will come up over the horizon of our common
life, ushering in a new day. And we are
bidden by our Lord Jesus to <i>watch</i>. We watch
for Him, and for anything that tells us His coming
is nearing.</p>

<p>Watching means wakefulness, an ideal, a purpose,
an expectancy, and a daily life under the
control of wakefulness, ideal, purpose, and expectancy.
That our Lord Jesus will actually
come to this old earth and reign, this is the ideal.
That we shall, by grace, be true to Him in everything,
day by day, during this waiting-time, this
is the purpose. That <i>we</i> shall indeed see Him
come, and be caught up into His presence without
death, this is the expectancy.</p>

<p>That this shall all be a real thing to us, <i>controlling</i>
all our relationships, our gold, and our
life, and that we shall reverently, thoughtfully
seek to understand what He has told us about it,
this is the wakefulness. This is what watching
means. Our bodies may be asleep, our brains
and hands absorbed in the day's task, but our
hearts can be awake for the sound ahead of
the coming of His feet.</p>

<p>&quot;But how can you watch for Him if there are
intervening events?&quot; So the question came
to me this summer by a thoughtful, godly min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Page 253]</a></span>ister
who looks for His coming. And I said:
&quot;Because His coming is one of a little group of
events which cluster about His coming.&quot;</p>

<p>The crowd stands watching at the railway
station in England to see the king's train come
in. Yet they know that before it comes the pilot-engine
will come, running ahead about so many
minutes to insure the safety of the way. The
coming of the pilot-engine heightens the intensity
of watching, for now soon the king will
come.</p>

<p>The watcher in the sick-chamber, weary with
the long night's anxious vigil, goes to the east
window to see if day is coming. There comes
a bare lighting-up in the east, just a slight lessening
of the darkness that is everywhere. But
even this much brings a sigh of relief. The sun
itself may not be seen for two hours or more.
But you know without looking at the clock that
the sun is coming and is near. Its presence near
sends the light far ahead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[186] Matthew xxiv. 33.</p></div><p>When the trees begin to send out swelling
bud and tender green leaf and catkin, we know
summer is coming, even though the chill is in
the air, and the night may even now bring a
touch of the white of frost. &quot;Even so ye also
<i>when ye see these things</i> know that <i>He</i> is nigh,
even at the doors.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><span class="snlabel">[186]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[187] 1 Chronicles xii. 32.</p></div><p>There's something intensely practical about
this thing of watching. I mean the intelligent
watching that a thoughtful study of God's Word
promotes. There is a striking sentence used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Page 254]</a></span>
describing some of the men that rallied to David
during the clearing-up storm that preceded his
reign. It is said of certain of the tribe of
Issachar that they &quot;<i>had understanding of the
times</i> to know what Israel ought to do&quot; in the
matter of making David the accepted king over
the realm.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><span class="snlabel">[187]</span> Their thoughtful study and judgment
of the time made them wise leaders of
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[188] Daniel xii. 10.</p><p>[189] Daniel viii. 15-17; ix. 1-2; x. 1-3, 11-14.</p></div><p>There is a similar significant word spoken to
Daniel in the final vision in which these end
events are being disclosed. And we recall that
the speaker is He for whose coming we look.
He says, &quot;They that are <i>wise</i> shall <i>understand</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><span class="snlabel">[188]</span>
Daniel had prayerfully set himself to
understand God's will for his people.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><span class="snlabel">[189]</span> When the
wonderful vision was given him in answer to his
patient study and continued prayer, the Man of
Fire who came to him said, &quot;Now I am come
to make thee <i>understand</i>.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>[190] Daniel xi. 33.</p></div><p>It is wise, by thoughtful, prayerful study of
God's Word, to try to understand what He has
told us. Not to do so is not wise. And more,
it will become increasingly needful that others
be taught as these events draw on. Daniel
is told in this same connection that &quot;They that
are wise shall instruct many.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><span class="snlabel">[190]</span></p>

<p>The opening words of the Revelation, and especially
the closing paragraphs, emphasize this
same thing. The revelation is given that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Page 255]</a></span>
may read and understand and hold our lives
true to this vision. This thing is intensely
practical. Indeed, it is <i>the</i> practical thing for
our day. We <i>can</i> understand the simple essentials
revealed here. Our Lord Jesus earnestly
desires us to do so. Surely we will, for His
sake.</p>

<h4>A Spirit Sensitiveness.</h4>

<p>The thoughtful watching that grows out of
an understanding of our Lord's plans influences
subtly and mightily one's whole life. It deepens
wondering reverence for the Lord Jesus Himself,
His present power and personal glory sitting
up yonder in the indescribable glory of the
Father's presence, and His patience and strength
in this waiting-time. It draws out a depth and
tenderness of personal love for Himself and of
devotion to Him.</p>

<p>There comes to be a keenly acute conscience
about evil, and about compromise with evil; and
yet with it a sanity of judgment on particular
questions arising, and a gentle consideration for
others who see otherwise, or think they do. Evil
grows in subtlety and in aggressiveness in our
day, and probably will yet more. It seeks especially
to make inroads among God's professing
people. Yet evil is evil. Its true inwardness is
quickly revealed by adding a &quot;d&quot; at the beginning
of the word. And it grows increasingly
repugnant in whatever guise, as we come to study
more its inner spirit as revealed in these disclosures
of the end times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Page 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, too, this watching affects one's judgment
of, and attitude toward, Christian service,
and toward movements in the Christian world.
The getting-together spirit is getting more and
more into Church circles. The fervent heart repeats
constantly our Lord's prayer, &quot;that they
may all be one.&quot; Yet it becomes clear that there
may be movements toward union that are not
of the Holy Spirit's initiation, and that cannot
have his approval.</p>

<p>It is not enough to do good. That may prove
to be a low level of action. <i>The</i> thing is to find
out what God has planned, and fit into that, with
all the warmth of one's being. His will is always
good, and better, and best. The good thing
may not be the thing He has planned and wants
done.</p>

<p>It becomes increasingly clear that our Lord
Jesus is a great general. He has the whole campaign
of action mapped out, and every detail
of it thought into and thought out. As one comes
to learn more of His plans, and Himself as a
planner, there comes to be <i>a passion for doing
His will</i>. One moves from the old position of
working for God up to the position of so fitting
in that <i>God works through us</i>.</p>

<p>And there comes to be a consciousness that He
is doing immensely more through the things we
do than we are conscious of. So in all Church
activity there comes to be a reaching out in spirit
to discern what <i>He</i> wants done, and putting all
the strength into that.</p>

<p>Then, too, one's thought of foreign missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Page 257]</a></span>
service undergoes a change. The actual taking
of the message of Christ to those who haven't
heard comes to have first place. Educational
work and medical and humanitarian, and the
like, in missionary service, are seen to be wisely
used when held strictly in place as a means to
a direct end. And their value is judged wholly
by their being a means of bringing those whom
they touch face to face with the Christ that
died.</p>

<p>It seems to be possible to spend fifty years
and more establishing mission work in the city
centres of a foreign-mission country, and all
good, blessed work; and yet have the great mass
of that country's population in utter ignorance
of the Gospel message and its power.</p>

<p>As the Holy Spirit is allowed control increasingly,
there comes to be a better understanding
of God's purposes and of His plans, an earnest
co&ouml;peration in the Church movement for making
Christ known to all men everywhere, a faithfulness
in all the circle of one's own home
Church, and a warm personal winning of men
to know the Lord Jesus as their Saviour.</p>

<p>So it is seen that watching for our Lord's return
affects one's whole life in an intensely practical
way. It deepens faith in <i>Him</i>. It leads to
an <i>intelligent detachment</i> in social and commercial
and even Church circles, while making an
increase of thoughtful regard for others. It
purifies the personal life. It chastens and deepens
and gentles the personal character.</p>

<p>It seems very striking and very strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Page 258]</a></span>
when Jesus was born there are just two persons
named, outside the immediate circle, who seemed
to have the spirit instinct that recognized who
He was. There was a man living in Jerusalem
whose name was Simeon. Who was he? rich?
poor? cultured? of lowly station? No one
knows. But whoever he was, he had cultivated
close walk with God. That's clear. And into his
inner spirit came the conviction that the Christ
promised for ages, so long waited for, the Christ
was now coming, and <i>he would see Him</i>.</p>

<p>And a similar story is told of the woman called
Anna. These two were in that simple touch of
heart with God that could in spirit sense the
coming of the Christ. There may have been
others. We are not told. But the emphasis
remains on the fact that few seemed to discern
the working out of God's tremendous plan.</p>

<p>Will it be so again? It would surely seem
that intelligent watching would make one sensitive
in spirit to coming events. Yet there would
ever be a mingling of deepest reverence, and a
thoughtful caution regarding mere speculation,
while the fervent prayer that Jesus taught is
daily repeated, &quot;Thy kingdom come.&quot;</p>

<p>And John's closing Revelation prayer constantly
breathes out, &quot;Even so, come, Lord
Jesus.&quot;</p>
